i have been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression by my family doctor they wrote a prescription for me to have an emotional support dog i have the paper work and i gave it to my apartment manager they said i cant keep the esd because im not disabled what do you suggest i do,this can be a difficult situation typically only animals that are specifically trains to accomplish a specific task are legally protected as service animsls even though that can be very helpful emotional support animals are not generally protected in the same wayyou might not be able to make your landlord accommodate you if possible you may want to consider a different apparent that is more animal friendly,Depression
i have been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression by my family doctor they wrote a prescription for me to have an emotional support dog i have the paper work and i gave it to my apartment manager they said i cant keep the esd because im not disabled what do you suggest i do,your apartment manager is legally required under federal law to allow the esa to live with you if you have provided documentation from a licensed therapist it does not matter if they have a nopet policy if you have met these qualificationsyou do not need a trained service animal nor do you need a disability for an emotional support animal the fair housing act which has federal jurisdiction allows you to own an esa if you have met the right criteria and it sounds like you do perhaps your apartment manager needs a letter from a therapist instead of a doctor heres the site for more information on this and steps to take httpsesadoctorscomlandlordemotionalsupportanimalmaybe your doctor is credible and can help you continue to fight for yourself in the above website it mentions that if you provide the required documentation and your apartment manager continues to deny you you can file a complaint with hud us department of housing and urban developmenti am repeating some of that article content here but i believe many people in this situation feel pressured to share personal information about their symptoms and circumstances beyond what is legally required for an esa you never have to share any information apart from the documents your therapist provides to you i think its amazing you are trying to stand up for yourself and i wish you all the best,Depression
i have been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression by my family doctor they wrote a prescription for me to have an emotional support dog i have the paper work and i gave it to my apartment manager they said i cant keep the esd because im not disabled what do you suggest i do,at present the american disability association ada only allows protection and guiltiness for service animals which is fall under a separate distinction from emotional support animals emotional support animals are untrained animals typically pets or other domestic animals that provide wonderful services to their owners and there are many benefits to having oneservice animals who are trained to provide specific services for an individual with limitations that make them fall under what the ada defines as disabled are protected under specific laws and must be accommodated in public places where the human they serve is present while it may be beneficial to request that the therapist who prescribed the dog to you write a letter to the apartment manager it sounds like the manager is aware of ada guidelines and the simplest course of action may be to find an alternative residence if that is a plausible option,Depression
i have been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression by my family doctor they wrote a prescription for me to have an emotional support dog i have the paper work and i gave it to my apartment manager they said i cant keep the esd because im not disabled what do you suggest i do,agree with the apartment managers viewpoint that your disability is not a physical limitationask the manager if theyd accept an explanatory letter from a therapist who is licensed to diagnosis emotional disabilitiesif the answer is yes then find a therapist whos willing to cooperate with what you need from them and find out this particular therapists terms of working with you to compose such a letterif the manager tells you no then find out who is above this person or entity and find out how to formally introduce your request to the board or apartment owner or whoever actually is the legal owner of the building,Depression
i have been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression by my family doctor they wrote a prescription for me to have an emotional support dog i have the paper work and i gave it to my apartment manager they said i cant keep the esd because im not disabled what do you suggest i do,this is tricky because there are different types of emotional support dogs the ones that are officially trained actually go through months of training and then are paired with someone for whom they perform specific tasksyou may benefit from looking at the blog written by valerie parrott who has an emotional support dog due to severe anxiety and panic i will warn you that her blog is very blunt but she is honest and she has gone through this process httpsthedogintheroomwordpresscom20160620whatmakesaservicedogmore508,Depression

there are many people willing to lovingly provide me with a home i have food clothes and a university education but i never feel like i belong even when i have a good time with people who are supposed to be close i feel like im just out with friends and i never go home,for some people having a sense of belonging takes some timeyou mentioned that you have an education and some basic daily needs i wonder if you may be able to look at your relationship with yourself and what makes you feel happy safe and having a sense of accomplishment if you have those feelings i wonder how you define trust and who you trustyou say you have a good time with people who are supposed to be close so i wonder what keeps them from feeling close i have also wondering if you have been emotionally hurt in the past and if so you may have some protective defenses that you use maybe on purpose maybe not to protect yourself from being hurt again remember that this idea comes in degrees where you can be more perfect in certain situations and a little less in others being emotionally protected is on a spectrum or continuum where you can make an infinite amount of adjustments or changes with different people and situationsi also wonder what it is that you want in your home and how you define it consider giving yourself permission to think about how you would define your perfect home in a world where there were no realistic restrictions such as money or location after you have that consider what parts of that you can have perhaps there is a small part that you could make a reality within a week or sothank you for reaching out if this continues to be difficult for you consider seeing a local mental health professional so you can discuss some more specific details,Depression
my girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed she told me that she wants to move what can i do to help her i want her to stay,youre probably not going to like my answeryour question says a lot about what you want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her sometimes whats best for a person is the hardest thing to do and may be completely opposite of what you wantaddictions dont happen in a vacuum if youve had any experience with addicts at all then im sure youve heard the term enabler a lot of the times when people think theyre helping theyre actually enabling the addict to continue their selfdestructive behavior tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations but especially with addictions family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to usedrink continuing to do so or relapsing back into ityou said she recently quit you said she is depressed she wants to move when a person receives counseling for addictions they are encouraged to make changes like this they need to break the habit and this means removing people from their lives at times it means moving to new locations anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed not only that but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out why they usedrink in the first place and not only break the physical addiction to it but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place she may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthydont pressure her to stay let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do if she stays the decision needs to be hers and hers alone it doesnt need to be made under pressure that will only lead to resentment support her but dont try to change her or make her do anything especially for selfish reasons let her go it sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now it wouldnt be a bad idea for you to do the same,Depression
my girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed she told me that she wants to move what can i do to help her i want her to stay,changing scenery often helps in recovery could you move with her moving could help her depression also is she also open to therapy being supportive is one way to help her and allowing her the space and ways to heal that suits her best,Depression
my girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed she told me that she wants to move what can i do to help her i want her to stay,i would say talk to her about her depression the best thing you can do is let her know that you are there for her as a support system i would encourage her to talk more if it helps and encourage her to get move involved in doing activities she likes to do also getting connected in a community of people is important to help with feeling depressed encourage her to speak with a therapist or counselor to address her depression as she has made a major change in her life by deciding to stop drinking she may believe moving is the best to help with this you can share with her that you want her to stay and express to her how you feel ultimately you will have to respect her boundaries and the decision she chooses to make she may want to move and this may be what she feels is best for her life if she does choose to move that will be her decision it sounds like she is trying to do what is going to make her happy maybe staying in the city she is currently in is causing her more feelings of sadness,Depression
my girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed she told me that she wants to move what can i do to help her i want her to stay,people often have very different values and opinions when they are drinking excessively and when they stop drinking so muchdid the two of you share drinking as an activity if yes then did you stop drinking toooften when partners meet each other as drinking buddies when one gets sober the relationship ends once the terms of any relationship changes one possibility is that it dissolvesthe best way to go is to start the conversation of what you genuinely want this is the only way shell really know your thoughtsask her to give serious consideration and discussion over at least a few weeks or months to moving away from you this is a fair request since you are in a relationshipif shes changed so much by giving up drinking which is possible that she no longer wants to be in relationship to you then you are better off being without a drinking gf even if the truth she delivers is a hurtful one,Depression
my girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed she told me that she wants to move what can i do to help her i want her to stay,after stopping the abuse of alcohol depressive symptoms are common she may benefit from exploring why she wants to move and see if she would still want to move if she did not feel depressed 12 step meetings can also be helpful,Depression
my girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed she told me that she wants to move what can i do to help her i want her to stay,you should start by speaking with her about what has her so down have their been some significant events in her life that have affected her have their been significant events in your relationship that can be affecting you both if she just stopped drinking she may be struggling to finding an alternative and healthier behavior this is something the two of you can explore together also if need be perhaps she can speak to a therapist to discuss her feelings about quitting alcohol it sounds like you really care and right now she could use all the support she can get despite her pushing you away,Depression

i had a very troubled up bringing and im currently dealing with alot right now i know some people may not think so but to me its a lot i feel overwhelmed could this be depression i use to be in therapy as a child alll throughout elementry middle and high school i had counseling  times a week i havent be in counseling lately though,thanks for reaching out with this important questionto start ill say the diagnosis for depression can differ depending on what the context of those markers are for example depression is diagnosed differently if theres a bipolar element or if someone is withdrawing from drugs or alcohol it doesnt sound like thats what youre experiencing but those are just two examples of many how thats diagnosed is a process that a therapist is best equipped to do in person with a thorough assessment sometimes we find that depression is subclinical meaning it doesnt reach the typical level of disorder that doesnt mean its less important or worthy of care most of the time diagnosis doesnt make a huge difference in treatment but there are some disorders that need pretty specific modalities and componentsfor example people with bipolar i often need medication to help stabilize symptomsid also say that more importantly you know yourself best you are clearly trying to make sense of some things you are feeling and maybe how they are connected to some things youve been through i can also see you are motivated to feel better no matter what others think your perceptions and experiences are most important you get to decide whether or not your circumstances are a lot for you not everyone is built the same and that is certainly impacted by trauma and significant stressors in the developmental years its also not your fault that things are hard you didnt ask for nor did you create your life experiencesoverall if you know some of your healing may come from naming what you feel you can absolutely continue to seek out solid information and maybe that will be with a counselor if thats what you desire kudos to you for asking this question here too you are dedicated to yourself whether you see it that way or not,Depression

im very depressed how do i find someone to talk to,the first step which youve taken is actually wanting to talk to someone its a great sign that you are seeking to reach out for help and there are therapists everywhere there are even therapists online so you dont have to be that close to them or their officethere are several sites that i refer people to to begin the process of looking for a therapist i usually have them start with psychologytodaycom once there there is a therapist directory you can narrow choices down by ages that they work with insurance they accept depression as an issue they focus in etc you can also narrow down by therapists modality but that can get complicated if you arent too familiar with the various theoretical approaches its important that you find someone that you feel understands your situation that might mean that they identify an issue you are having in their profile or on their professional website but you should try to meet a couple of different therapists if you arent quite sure it can be challenging that first session but your best note not the best therapist will help you feel comfortable or as comfortable as possible given therapy can be uncomfortable especially at first and understood from the getgoi have found that asking friends or family for names and recommendations is also a common way to find a therapist because it can come from a trusted referral source but remember that we are all different so what works for one might not always be a good fit and again it could take a couple of first sessions with different therapists to know if someone is a good fit sometimes it can take a few sessions and if there is no one around that can give a name or two then searching online is quite common and can yield positive resultsand try not to give up finding a therapist is not easy but finding a good one for you is extremely rewarding,Depression

i have bipolar disorder paranoid personality disorder posttraumatic stress disorder anxiety and obsessivecompulsive disorder i last selfharmed a week ago when i am stressed overwhelmed hurt or angry the urge to selfharm is all i can think of i am trying to seek help,glad you are reaching out herethere are two types of selfharm suicidal and nonsuicidal a lot of people i see and have seen engage in selfharm just to manage emotional dysregulation but not to end their lives selfinjury actually does a great job at helping us to manage really intense emotional stateseven from a chemical level in the body when you selfharm its triggers your bodys endorphin production which is a chemical that makes us feel good im not saying you should do it but i understand why you would choose that option because it is pretty powerfulto answer your question ive never heard of anyone being admitted into inpatient for trying to stop nonsuicidal selfinjuring even some people ive worked with that are suicidal and selfharming have remained outpatient given we have an extensive safety plan including how to reach out for help and coping skill development unless you are at high risk of suicide you would most likely be outpatient i also work from a harm reduction model meaning that if you have to selfharm it might as well be as safe as possible when people are trying to stop sometimes the pressure gets in the way and they relapse very normal and actually expected so we prepare for that by discussing measures to take to make sure the method you use is very safe things here include making sure anything piercing the skin is properly disinfected areas on the body to avoid cutting and selfharm alternatives that still cause pain but are much safer for example some people hold ice in the palm of their hands or snap rubber bands on their wrists there are many websites that have safer alternatives as well if you just do a quick google search have patience with yourself here too youve found a way to manage a whole lot of emotionsand its worked for youyou did that by yourself you also want better for yourself and have made the first steps for change and thats really spectacular itll be similar to quitting any habit so stick in there and if you find a counselor that fits for you even better i wish you so much luck,Depression
i have bipolar disorder paranoid personality disorder posttraumatic stress disorder anxiety and obsessivecompulsive disorder i last selfharmed a week ago when i am stressed overwhelmed hurt or angry the urge to selfharm is all i can think of i am trying to seek help,seeking professional help does not mean that you will necessarily be admitted into an inpatient setting  though to be honest that can become an option if you feel unsafe or if you are unable to plan for safety however many clients who struggle with selfharm can find help in outpatient settings  particularly those which offer a treatment called dialectical behavioral therapy dbt looking for a dbt professional or group therapy setting may be particularly helpful but a skilled professional can help you to figure out how to identify other options even when you are experiencing overwhelming emotions without knowing your location i also recommend searching to find your local helpline or suicide prevention hotline the volunteers on the other end of the line can be very helpful even if your intention is not suicide and they are likely also to be able to connect you with resources in your area calling into the helpline may also be a first step alternative to selfharming when youre feeling overwhelmed,Depression

i have twin toddlers i experienced a death of loved one prior to giving birth i had a horrible break up with the father people told him he was using me for money my exboyfriend had extreme meltdowns every day for three years im always alone with no friends,seems like youve really been through the ringer without much of a break just reading through the details you put in the question i hear a couple things one is that you seem like a helper thats not bad at all though other people taking advantage of your nurturing qualities and not giving that back to yourself can really zap your energy seems like you were the one that had to take care of your ex for a very long time think about what that takesa lot of patience great emotional awareness flexibility to adjust to needs and change plans etc what that also means is that you probably had to focus so heavily on him that you werent able to give any of that attention to yourself the great part is that it doesnt look a whole lot different when you give that to you vs someone else selflove and selfcare is a really important piece of managing anxiety and depression as you learned with your exthe other thing i noticed is that it sounds like you maybe tend to peopleplease this is common with people that are helpersthey are almost a package deal peoplepleasing is really about abandonment its derived from a fear that if you arent exactly what people need they may have negative feelings toward you and ultimately abandon or reject you may also stem from a need for peace if you grew up in a chaotic home common with kiddos from domestic violence backgrounds though that usually has some type of connection to abandonment as wellas far as anxiety management goes theres so much you can do its hard to say what will work specifically for you but first thing that might help is to understand your triggers what gives you anxiety is it general and seems to come out of nowhere or does it buildup and get worse at a certain time of day i find that many people who have unresolved grief and depression tend to cycle through those symptoms and anxiety because theres so much stress and pressure involved in the cluster of issues that those circumstances tend to bring sorting those things out can be toughif you need help from a friend or counselor its never too late to reach out it doesnt matter if it happened last week or 10 years ago if it matters to you its relevanti hope some of this helps and you are able to find someone in your life to lean on you arent meant to be alone,Depression

my motivation has gone away its hard to get out of bed i really dont know what to do anymore im miserable my anxiety and depression have taken over my life,you are so not alone in that theres many many people that struggle with feeling stuck with the combination of depressive and anxious symptoms you are right thoughit is a miserable thing to go throughthe most important thing i usually start with for clients upon learning about their particular situation is behavioral activation which is just a fancy name for doing stuff walking is a good place to start because its not hard on the body and you arent going from bed to running a marathon its a way to get those feelgood chemicals flowing and to also feel like you are doing something whether or not theres any motivation there other people go with tasks such as cleaning or organizing sometimes those more productive things can make us feel good about ourselves and doing them over and over can build up into confidence that you do have agency in your life another option is participating in things you think youd do if depression and anxiety werent taking over your life we tend to believe that we have to feel a certain way to do something exciting or meaningful but the truth is that sometimes doing things comes first and the feelings we have about them follow this may take a while and it may mean combining other techniques like thoughtlogging journaling about when certain thought patterns are triggered and even medicationcounseling it all depends on the person engaging in activity may help to lower some of that anxiety also because youre energy has somewhere to be channeled through besides your nervous system doing things really has a power in and of itself that teaches us what we are capable of its hard not to let your feelings and thoughts con you into believing you are incapable or hopeless but thats what it is a con what you choose and what works best for you may also depend on the factors of your situation have you been feeling this way for a long time did it come on suddenly and take over within the timeframe of a couple weeks or was there a situation that triggered it all those things are helpful to know because longterm depressionanxiety require a different spin on techniques than something more shortterm that may benefit from processing through a difficult event or learning coping skills to push through a depressive episode all types can benefit from processing and learning new skills but predicting patterns and being proactive means knowing those detailshope this was a bit helpful,Depression
im in my early s ive worked since two months after i turned  i have plans i could become an electrician or i could operate heavy machinery i have goals but i do nothing to try to meet them because i dont feel i can i just want a better life for my fiance and the kids than i did,if youre not following the goals you gave yourself there are two possibilitiesyou dont really like your goalsyou selfsabotage and prevent yourself from your own strengths and accomplishmentsthink through each of theseif youve set goals which arent true to your nature then intuitively some part of you will reject themif you selfsabotage get in your own way from achieving what you truly would like then ask questions of yourself around whether you feel undeserving of success,Depression
im in my early s ive worked since two months after i turned  i have plans i could become an electrician or i could operate heavy machinery i have goals but i do nothing to try to meet them because i dont feel i can i just want a better life for my fiance and the kids than i did,for starters commend yourself for being committed to working you have no idea what is going to happen in the next second so focusing on thinking you will never have a good career or amount to anything financially is creating a fictitious story remind yourself of that every time the thought pops up the false belief that nothing good will happen is sucking out energy you can use on pursuing your career dreams next do you know what you need to do to become an electrician or heavy machinery operator if not find out then set up a realistic schedule for yourself to accomplish the steps as you accomplish each step see your progress notice that you are moving closer to your goal every day remind yourself why you are pursuing this career in fact write it down and tape it on your bathroom mirror when you start to feel discouraged remember your goal and remind yourself that you have no idea if youll make it or not but you are going to give it everything you have to find out anything worth pursuing is going to take a lot of persistence and hard work stay with it you and your family are worth it,Depression

i stress over everything if i dont have enough quality time with my boyfriend i start to feel resentment towards him he has three children and they are great kids but i find we dont have much time together i break down easily and find myself depressed,everyone has some level of anxiety  its what helps us respond to stressors in our lives and clues us into the fact that we need to respond to something going on however if youre feeling overwhelmed by racing thoughts feeling like you spend a lot of energy worrying about something specific or even pretty much anything at all and youre starting to find that its getting in your way when it comes to living your life the way you want then id suggest seeing a counselor or therapist for an assessment for anxiety your other concerns though seem pretty normal for someone who is in a relationship with a partner who has children as a married stepmother ive been there and as a therapist i can tell you that the boundaries and communication skills you have in your relationships need to be healthy for you to feel healthy finding some support from a group of others whose partners have children might be really helpful  being able to hear from others that you arent alone in feeling like this can really lighten the load and they might have some good ideas for handling certain situations another option is to find a counselor or therapist who has experience working with stepblended family dynamics  because even if youre not officially married those dynamics come into play whenever there are kids from another relationship involved you may even consider couples counseling so that both of you can learn to talk about your relationship needs and concerns in a way that will encourage connection and strengthen your sense of partnership,Depression
i stress over everything if i dont have enough quality time with my boyfriend i start to feel resentment towards him he has three children and they are great kids but i find we dont have much time together i break down easily and find myself depressed,feeling neglected in a romantic relationship can be pretty painful so i dont think your response is anything out of the ordinary i do wonder what you mean when you say you stress over everything and break down easily is that according to your own assessments or someone elses what do those moments look like within the context of a lot of stress breaking down wouldnt take a whole lotand its ok to break down its the bodys way of releasing pent up emotions if thats coming out via aggression or selfharm it may be time well spent to create a coping plan for those tough times in order to feel like you have more control over your default responsesometimes voicing your needs can help people to meet them or at least compromise if you feel he would be receptive to a discussion let him know how much time you need a day or week you may not even fully know that but if hes flexible you can test out what feels right for your relationship,Depression

im currently struggling with diagnosed depression anxiety and misophonia also i am  sure i have borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder i read the dsmiv taken college psychology etc i know it in my heart i have them is selfdiagnosing okay with the right research,one of the ways a diagnosis is helpful has more to do with health providers having a common language with which to discuss their patients arriving at a diagnosis requires gathering quite a bit of data on an individual which includes observation i would not recommend selfdiagnosing as it could be challenging for an individual to be objective no matter how much research they have done further i do not believe in pathologizing individuals nor would i recommend anyone pathologize themselves,Depression
im currently struggling with diagnosed depression anxiety and misophonia also i am  sure i have borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder i read the dsmiv taken college psychology etc i know it in my heart i have them is selfdiagnosing okay with the right research,sounds like you are really concerned about the things you are feeling and the way you are interacting with others selfdiagnosing is not typically recommended since there could be a misinterpretation of the criteria even if you do seem to fit the mold how you interpret how you feel or how you behave can be distorted no matter who you are i actually did this to myself when i was in graduate school and it turned out to be wrongwith that being said i believe people are the experts on their lives and know best what is happening for them what is telling you that you have these diagnoses what does it mean about you if you do i dont give a ton of weight to diagnoses in the sense of treatment because a lot of diagnoses share the same underlying themes and origins both borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder can be a result of childhood trauma so treating one may not look that different from treating the other oneand the most important factor will always be the relationship you have with your therapist otherwise treatment wont worki do give a lot of weight to diagnoses in terms of emotional relief it can be really stressful to feel like theres something wrong with you and not be able to give it a category it can reduce stigma as well to know that whats happening to you is normal for what youve been through and that others are going through it too and it definitely helps to know that there are ways to help and people that know how to help youeither way kudos to you for noticing something in your life that you want to change it seems like relationships are important to you and you maybe worry you are pushing people away that are important to you even if you do have these disorders you can totally learn how to change your life,Depression
im currently struggling with diagnosed depression anxiety and misophonia also i am  sure i have borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder i read the dsmiv taken college psychology etc i know it in my heart i have them is selfdiagnosing okay with the right research,any diagnosis is limited in its usefulnessknowing the name of some typical ways you may feel think and behave doesnt help you or anyone to understand why the person is the way they are and how to change any of these characteristicsboth selfdiagnosing and being diagnosed are equally unhelpful to know why you are the way you are and what to do about itconsider yourself a person who wants to find a better way to be who you are and this will get you further with better results than to read a list of descriptions which all are very indicting and negative sounding,Depression
im currently struggling with diagnosed depression anxiety and misophonia also i am  sure i have borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder i read the dsmiv taken college psychology etc i know it in my heart i have them is selfdiagnosing okay with the right research,hello and thank you for your question selfdiagnosing is something that we all do about one health issue or another taking a guess about what may or may not be happening to us is completely normal however the actual clinical diagnoses of a mental health disorder requires a licensed mental health professional here are a few reasons for this 1 making a clinical diagnosis often requires other things besides matching up the symptoms of a disorder to come to a diagnoses for any of the things you mentioned a counselor would consult the dsm but they may also use some type of screening tool assessment or scale many disorders have similarities and it requires someone with training to tease out the differences in the symptoms 2 our judgement is sometimes off when it comes to assessing ourselves we really cant be objective something as serious as determining a diagnosis really needs to be done by someone who has that objectivity in addition once you know your diagnosis treating it usually requires help from a professional 3 sometimes the symptoms of a mental health disorder makes selfdiagnoses impossible in and of itself for example someone could be having hallucinations or delusions and not realize it that would clearly make it impossible for them to diagnose themselves there a many examples where something like this could happen with different mental health disorders there are other reasons but these are three important ones now does this mean that you are wrong about your diagnosis maybe not you may be correct but it is important to get this confirmed by a professional mental health clinician if a disorder is then found you can begin to talk about treatment hope this was helpful be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc,Depression
i am pretty sure i have depression and anxiety i also have voices in my head i have problems sleeping too ive already been diagnosed with attentiondeficit disorder and obsessivecompulsive disorder i have selfharmed in the last and used to be suicidal how do i tell them this and ask for therapy,talking with parents can be very challenging even if they are loving and understanding have you ever discussed these issues in the past if so how did they respond itd make sense if you were avoiding a discussion if they have responded negatively to you or even neutrally we rely on our parents for action when we are in need and it can feel so disappointing when they dont meet our needs if this is the case for you you could still reach out to them if you feel safe to that might mean being very candid about what you need from them or what you are seeking for yourself sounds like you already know you are struggling and you want to get some help which is awesomedo you worry they wont believe you or that theyll be disappointed in you for selfharming if you are struggling with these worries it may be worth talking to another trusted adult about how to bring the issues up to your parents maybe that adult could be part of the conversation if appropriate or available also do you have any siblings that are old enough to be part of the conversation or maybe be a shoulder to lean on no matter what happens social support is really important so you dont have to go through it all aloneis it possible that your parents or even one of your parents will be proud of you for speaking up for yourself and trying to get help sometimes depression and anxiety immobilizes us because we fear the worst when in reality there are many more possibilities one of the things i have my teen clients work on if they want to communicate something to a caregiver is have them come up with a bulletpoint list of the things they need them to know so maybe your list would include symptoms youve been struggling with how you want to change and what you need from them to help you change if you do this and it doesnt turn out well remember that its on them and not you sometimes parents are doing the best they can and sometimes its not good enough that never means you arent worth helping it could be helpful to make a backup plan for how you will try to reach out to someone if they dont respond wellyou also dont specify your age or if you are even a teen im assuming you are but if not you may be able to get help without their consent or help if you are closer to age 18 you may not have long to wait i truly hope you find what you need,Depression

i cant seem to feel any emotion except anxiety not even for myself,thank you for posting im interested to hear some more information such as if you live by yourself or family if you go to schoolemployedunemployed and what kind of things do you like to do with friends or by yourself often times when we are experiencing a strong emotion that we interpret as negative we put most of our focus on that negative emotion and struggle to see that we do not always feel that specific emotion there are typically points in the day even if it is for only in 1 minute intervals when we do not feel that negative emotion when we overgeneralize we use words like always or never and when we use those words and it may not be totally true we feel the negative emotion based on an inaccuracy which is not fair to you ask yourself some of these questions am i being realistic when im overgeneralizing things have i ever noticed a short period of time that i wasnt feeling anxious what do i notice when i am feeling anxious what am i thinking about when was the last time i felt empathy what was different when i was able to feel empathy hopefully this helps get you started,Depression
i cant seem to feel any emotion except anxiety not even for myself,its not normal to feel no empathymaybe you do have a little more empathy for yourself than you realize since you seem to express some empathy toward yourself not feeling emotionstry to understand the circumstance about which you feel anxiety this may increase your empathy toward yourselfif you feel anxiety about a relationship then empathize with having lost the relationshipif you feel anxiety about not having enough funds to pay bills then empathize with yourself for this situationif you feel anxiety about how someone engages with you then empathize with feeling unsure of how to respond to thisbasically see if you can substitute empathy toward yourself for the tension of your anxiety,Depression
i cant seem to feel any emotion except anxiety not even for myself,its very common to lose the ability to experience empathy when you are overwhelmed burned out andor exhausted empathy is about accessing your own emotions in a way to understand someone elses experience or circumstance if theres something in you emotionally that you may be trying to avoid it may shutdown your willingness to feel or express empathy altogether this also happens often with emotional exhaustion as well as if we arent putting up boundaries with our empathy brene brown has a great video on this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5u3vcguzqiione way to think about this is to ask yourself what your anxiety is trying to tell you is there maybe something that you arent addressing in your life that is bugging you or do you feel you are addressing too much and are spread too thin im also unsure if your comment means you dont have any emotion for yourself or you dont have anxiety for yourself but i want to point out that you do have some sort of emotion for yourself thats the very reason you have asked this question fear does a stellar job at masking emotions like sadness and shame you may not be aware of these feelings but they could still existloss of empathy can sometimes lead to a disconnection from the pain of others though the extreme versions of this are not very common if you do start to experience homicidal ideation or thoughts about seriously harming others its important you talk to someone right away,Depression
i cant seem to feel any emotion except anxiety not even for myself,empathy usually falls on a spectrum meaning that some people show more than others empathy is the ability to look at the world through someone elses eyes or walk a mile in their shoes there could be some people in your life for whom empathy is easier to feel and those for whom you have no idea what they are experiencingempathy is not usually categorized as an emotion but as something related to emotions for example you could have empathy about someones anxietyim not sure whether you are also referring to the idea that you dont have sympathy for yourself or others thats a different concept but also involves different degreeswhen you say you dont have emotion except anxiety i wonder if you are saying that you have anxiety all the time and it may be covering up other emotions if you are experiencing a lot of anxiety try to look at what it connects to and find something that changes your focus for a few minutes this could be any number of activities such as watching tv cooking reading a book or many other optionsif you are feeling as if you are just going through the motions and not having a lot of emotions about anything if its just been a few days it may just be related to a current stress that will lessen in a few days if it has been quite a while consider tracking your mood and looking at when you do notice changes in your emotions there may be some variations that you are not aware ofif you continue to feel anxious and as if you dont have as many emotions as you would like consider talking with your primary care physician or a local therapist,Depression
i cant seem to feel any emotion except anxiety not even for myself,empathy is the ability to tap into our own experience to help us connect with others in order to be aware of how they are experiencing life it is a skill that we learn with practice and refine as we become mature if you are feeling anxious maybe you are able to understand better others who are going trough anxiety but i wonder if instead of feeling empathy you may just want to find ways to reduce your anxiety a good idea is to be very aware of your anxiety triggers and once you identify them explore other ways you could react sera normal que no sienta empataparece que no puedo experimentar ninguna otra emocin que no sea ansiedad ni si quiera por m misma empata es la habilidad de usar tus propias experiencias para conectarte con otros y estar consciente de la manera que ellos experimentan la vida es una destreza interpersonal que aprendemos y refinamos con la prctica y segn maduramos como personas si te ests sintiendo ansioso tal vez puedas comprender mejor como otra persona experimenta momentos de ansiedad pero me pregunto si en lugar de estar buscando sentir empata realmente quisieras reducir tus niveles de ansiedad una buena manera es estar consciente que activa la ansiedad y ya que lo identifiques explora que otras reacciones pudieras tener,Depression

i have been feeling more and more down for over a month i have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks but they are almost never triggered by something that i know of,the first thing i usually recommend to clients that are coming in for these issues in addition to stress management is visiting their doctor we really dont know if its something psychological thats influencing your symptoms or if theres other issues happening within the body pancreas or thyroid issues can perpetuate anxiety and depression symptoms pretty intenselythese are things your doctor knows more about and can help test for and maybe rule outas you probably already know lack of sleep is a giant contributor to an increase in symptoms we dont know too much about sleep in the research but we do know its necessary to function and function well some suggestions here from the research we do have creating a calming routine at night can help with your bodys relationship to sleep this can be your normal nightly hygiene paired with some relaxing videos or soundscapes there are apps for thiscalm headspace panicshield practicing these for a few weeks can help your brain pair your routine with sleeping another suggestion directly from the research is not to take naps yes your brain needs sleep but napping messes with our circadian rhythm and our qualityquantity of nightly sleep when we sleep we go through sleep stagesbut when we nap those stages arent completed like they would be during a full night of sleep where we go through those stages multiple times both deep sleep and rem sleep typically when we dream seems to be especially important for feeling rested napping usually only offers us a small dose of that whereas a full night can offer as many more completed cycles including both these stages if you are waking into a panic attack this site may give you some info on what that means httpswwwmayoclinicorgdiseasesconditionspanicattacksexpertanswerspanicattacksfaq20057984 heres a great information website that has tons of resources including support groups httpswashingtoncenterforcognitivetherapycomproblemstreatedpanicdisorderpanicdisorderorganizationsglad you reached out here,Depression
i have been feeling more and more down for over a month i have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks but they are almost never triggered by something that i know of,answers about our inner lives are most successfully reached from a sense of feeling grounded in oneselffirst step is to accept your nervousness and restless sleep as often as possible sleep during daytimes in order for your body to catch up on its need for restaccept too about feeling down it is normal to feel down once in a while from this place of selfacceptance trust any answers which come up to your mind often answers about complicated topics come in small pieces not all at once as a whole unitalso your description about panic attacks is also completely normal they often arise unrelated to particular conditions at a given moment they are a healthy symptom your body is trying to expel bad feelings and does this by having the anxiety erupt at timesso selfacceptance tolerance of being on a process of clearing out worn out emotional clutter and sleep at odd times if possible are all ways to stabilize yourself which will also feel calm and good,Depression
i have been feeling more and more down for over a month i have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks but they are almost never triggered by something that i know of,it could be really helpful to see a counselortherapist about your increasing depressionpanic symptoms finding out the cause of depressionanxiety isnt always as straightforward as it seems since both issues tend to become patterns we engage in rather than solely related to a specific triggerreason for example if i am feeling down about a particular circumstance in my life then i start seeing life through this lens of feeling down and typically ill start to see a lot more that i get down about and it can really build very quickly on itself same with anxiety obviously this is a very simplified example and it can be very difficult to see how the pattern is maintained but thats where working with a counselortherapist comes in i would be curious about whether you can start to notice the initial sensations of panic and if you can through the panic attack continue to maintain awareness of the actual physical sensations even better if you can talk yourself through the sensations youre feeling  such as saying to yourself okay im breathing really rapidly and my heart is racing now my palms are sweaty and my chest is feeling really tight reminding yourself that its just your bodys reaction to stress and while it might be overreacting right now youre okay and eventually it will go away i highly recommend the sam for anxiety management app for the anxiety piece and i wouldnt be surprised if addressing the anxiety helped to address some of the depression too,Depression
i have terrible anxiety and depression ive tried various therapists and pills but nothings helped,is it possible you simply didnt mix well with the particular therapists with whom youve worked if this is possible interview a therapist before starting therapy then you will be choosing a therapist who feels compatible with your way of seeing yourself and your lifealso therapy isnt for everyoneread about the different healing modalities and see if one of these speaks to your interest in feeling betterwhat matters most is finding among all the legitimate healing methods what you believe will be effective,Depression
i have terrible anxiety and depression ive tried various therapists and pills but nothings helped,im sorry youve had a difficult time finding what you need sounds like you have been trying super hardits common for people to go through a few therapists before they find a fit i agree with the prior post that relationship is the most important factor in counseling otherwise techniques dont really work it can be the case that you are connecting with your counselor but not able to implement what you are learning for whatever reason thats pretty typical in depression when lethargy is high and motivation is low have you discussed your medication with your prescribing provider it seems like you have advocated for yourself in the past and have put some effort into trying new things thats actually really tough to do depression or not when i have clients that seem to make no progress despite many sessions and different medications i recommend trying a service called genesight heres the link httpsgenesightcomthis service allows you find medications that fit best with your genetic makeup i dont have any affiliation to this service but ive seen some success for people that have followed through since it is very personalized i believe some insurance companies cover the full cost and its easy to uselet me also point out that your motivation is spectacular you have been through multiple therapists and meds yet you still reach out on this forum filled with counselors that shows some dedication to yourself and hope that you can find help to change thats not easy with depression or anxiety,Depression
i have terrible anxiety and depression ive tried various therapists and pills but nothings helped,im sorry that you have tried several different things and not had much reliefi will say that there are several different types of medications that may help and each therapist is different so it is quite possible that a different combination of things youve already tried may be helpfuli would encourage you to continue trying different therapists i would say to give each one at least six sessions before you decide that the approach that they are using is not working for you also most places have a certain sort of structured initial session that must be done but after that the decisions are largely up to what you and the clinician feel is helping if something is or is not working communicate this with your therapist this is a big deal most therapists i know actually welcome this feedbackthere is a fair amount of research into the idea that the therapeutic alliance the relationship that you have in the context of working through the reasons that brought you into therapy is very important also sometimes anxiety and depression can make it difficult to go to therapy on a regular basis if that is something with which you are struggling i would encourage you to talk about that as wellin addition to a solid relationship with a therapist who you connect with you may consider trying something like yoga or meditation mindfulness is sometimes helpful as wellheres a link to questions for finding suitable therapists httpwwwpharmatherapistcom12tipsforfindingasuitabletherapist,Depression

i selfharm and i stop for awhile then when i see something sad or depressing i automatically want to selfharm,in a way selfharm can present somewhat like an addiction according to new research within the field of neuroscience there is a valid explanation for this when a person cuts or uses other forms of self harm the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better if a person was dealing with depression or high anxiety that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better and a new neural network or map might form addiction that would utilize this new behavior another way to look at it would be thru a behavioral lens a positive reward for a behavior even though the behavior has other long term negative consequences consider working with someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes in this case sadness or depression and second find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior such as snapping a rubber band on the wrist and working to extinguish the unwanted behavior someone who is trained in dialectic behavior therapy andor interpersonal neurobiology would most likely have the skills and means available to address this with you,Depression
i selfharm and i stop for awhile then when i see something sad or depressing i automatically want to selfharm,selfharm has a way of becoming a goto method of coping when we get stuck using selfharm as a way to deal and manage emotions when something serious happens it totally makes sense that that will be one the first things to go through the mind it is its own kind of addiction there is a therapy dbt or dialectical behavior therapy which focusing on giving you new tools to get through hard times understand and manage your emotions to stay present and to deal with relationships this one of the most effective interventions there is for selfharm if you are interested in dbt reach a local therapist in your area and ask if they do dbt or can recommend you to a dbt program this can help immensely selfharm recovery is totally possible but it is definitely hard work,Depression
its not entirely true to say i enjoy being sad but i always find a way to feel that way i listen to sad music read tragic stories and in a twisted way like how bad it makes me feel i focus on negative aspects of my life even if they arent legitimate or i just make it seem negative,it sounds like you are noticing that you are drawn towards sad and negative content and its hard to understand why this may sound counterintuitive but sometimes we do things that on the surface may look problematic or even cause us some real problems because it serves us in some unseen way a simple example would be somebody who is addicted to a substance their addiction may be causing serious problems in their life and they may even know it but the addiction serves them by helping them to avoid painful feelings that they anticipate having if they quit using now i am not saying that what you describe is an addiction it is just a really illustrative example of the unseen benefitone thing i would be wondering about is what is the unseen benefit of seeking out sad and negative content id also be wondering what your relationship is to other feelings these are things you may benefit from exploring with a competent therapist,Depression
its not entirely true to say i enjoy being sad but i always find a way to feel that way i listen to sad music read tragic stories and in a twisted way like how bad it makes me feel i focus on negative aspects of my life even if they arent legitimate or i just make it seem negative,i applaud your courage in asking this question to gain some deeper insight into what is happening in your life this is one of the most common things that i personally have seen in the population of individuals who suffer from depression it is often that i notice clients focusing on the negative to the complete dismissal of the positive when they are dealing with depression it is inspiring that you have noticed this in yourself because many clients are not aware that this is a pattern for them or are not yet willing to face that depression has become a pattern they cling to depression if dealt with for extended periods of time can become a way of life an identity of sorts that is very difficult to part from while you desperately desire happiness who would you be without the depression sometimes it is scarier to journey into the unknown in this case happiness than it is to stay in the known and the often times comfortable space of your depression human beings for the most part fear and stray away from change in general especially a change that is so impactful allowing yourself to confront the possibility of change as positive with the support of a professional counselor is often extremely helpful,Depression
i just dont know what i want in life anymore im cant figure out what it is that is keeping me distracted and unfocused i cant put things into perspective at all im just stuck and im disappointed with my lack of accomplishments,if you are a peoplepleaser type or a natural caretaker you can slowly lose yourself over time if you are always tending to the needs of others and neglecting yourself if this sounds like a familiar pattern for you this may have happened without you even realizing it if you were raised in a family where you had to pick up the slack alot maybe your parents were addicts or they might have even just worked all the time and you learned to take care of everything because that is what you had to do to help the family run smoothly over time a person who grows up in this type of environment learns that you put the needs of others before your own you might also be stuck in these types of patterns in intimate relationships as well if you completely give yourself over to your significant other and you dont create a life for yourself with your own interests and supportive friends you are at risk of losing what is unique and amazing about you if you grew up in a family where you learned this role out of survival or because it was needed to take care of your family its easy to recreate this in adult relationshipsin both scenarios if there is no awareness that this self sacrifice at the expense of others is going on your identity is shaped around being a caretakerenablerpeoplepleaser and down the road it can lead to depression low self esteem and a confused sense of self basically you spend so much time helping other people that you dont make time for yourself or create a life of fulfillment before you realize it you have been living a life for others instead of yourself and you have no idea who you are supporting loved ones and friends is important and certainly admirable but if you are always that person that rescues those that rely on you begin to take advantage of you and they will suck you dry if you let them in conclusion learning to set boundaries with those in your life that are too needy becomes a really important part of the process when you begin to recognize that you are unhappy and unfulfilled in life it sounds like you may be at that crossroads right now take one small step at at a time identify the worst offenders in your life that suck time and energy and limit your contact andor set some strong boundaries with those people so you can refocus and do some soulsearching meanwhile engage in pleasurable activities with people you enjoy being with get yourself outside in the fresh air get some good sleep and eat some nourishing food,Depression

i have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years i have been on medication but lately my depression has felt worse can counseling help,certainly counselling can help however there is a caveat namely you will need the right counsellor with the right approach this leads to two questions 1 what are the identifiers for the right counsellor and 2 what is the right approach1 what are the identifiers for the right counsellor the right counsellor will almost certainly have a lot of experience he or she will have done a lot personal work and have an ongoing practice of inner work both on their own and with the support of an experienced therapist this person will be viewing you as a human being with challenges not as a diagnostic category he or she will be willing to work with you over an extended period of time and have experience doing such work further they will be well versed in approaches that are responsive to you in the moment and overall the indepth work will be collaborativel designed in an ongoing way that is responsive to you the moment your overall life experience and their inthemoment experience it goes without saying that you will subjectively evaluate the felt sense of connection with this person and the feeling that they are invested in their work with you value you as a human being and value the connection as well it is crucial that you feel this connection and that your therapist gets you 2 what is the right approach as carl jung stated when the doctor sits down with the patient he or she must drop all theories and learn the theory of this person the approach must include a bond between you and your therapist that is in a continuous process of development attention to preverbal imprinting development of awareness ability ongoing development of the ability to attend to and stay with inner experience development of a process orientation attention to egoic structures that were seeded from the earliest days in the service of perceptions of threats to needs being met identification of current egoic states and work with these inner selves and their relationship with each other to facilitate movement from developmental points of arrest increased ability to access and contain nonordinary states of consciousness attending to what is and working with this in the service of moving towards optimal human developmentdepression is generally experienced as the system shutting down anxiety is a signal that something is wrong anxiety is not the problem it is a sign that there is a problem the core of these issues is a lack of inner security that is the outcome of insufficient bonding the work of psychotherapy is to establish an environment and relationship that will facilitate work with the bonding ruptures and reinitiation of the developmental process that stopped at an early stage,Depression

i have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years i have been on medication but lately my depression has felt worse can counseling help,from whom do you get antidepressantsthis person should be talking with you to know whether the pills are helping or nottrust your own instinct that the pills arent helping youpills work differently for everyone and not all people feel better from themit is also possible the particular pills have lost their effectiveness because after around six to eight months this usually happenstry to understand what is depressing you this is slow work since you may have many theoriesjust by addressing your own emotional needs and life structure in a caring and respectful way may improve your mood so that youll feel less depressed,Depression
i am really worried about one of my friends because i think he has major depression he disagrees with me on that he is shut off when it comes to talking to people and telling them how he really feels he told me he feels empty inside and the only emotions he feels are anger and sadness i suggested to him to get help and talk to his mom about it but he refuses,first of all i can tell that you really care about your friend and i think its great that you are reaching out with your concern its hard to determine whether your friend would meet the criteria for an official diagnosis of depression without working with him however whether he does or not therapy may be beneficial for him in working through these difficult feelings and relational challenges unfortunately you cant make your friend get help he will ultimately need to make that decision for himself however you can talk to him about your concerns and your hopes that he will reach out for help,Depression
ive become so jaded that i cant control my thoughts i cannot focus on anything and been having anxiety attacks,maybe your thoughts require your attention and the best course would be to pay attention and follow themif youre in an especially stressful or uncertain time in your life then the best way through is to understand the tension you feelit keeps trying to get you to know whats going on deep within youanxiety is a sign of stress and weariness your thoughts are a chance to simply rest and know what they would like you to knowthen when that process is finished your anxiety will no longer be necessary and will most likely leave you alone,Depression
ive become so jaded that i cant control my thoughts i cannot focus on anything and been having anxiety attacks,i imagine that its pretty disconcerting to feel as though you lost yourselfwhen you said that you are jaded im not sure whether you mean that you are jaded toward someone something life in general or some combination thereofone of the difficult things about anxiety is that anxiety can lead to more anxiety because of being concerned about having another panic attack consider remembering that panic attacks usually only last a few minutes and the reason they dont go away right away is because of the way your brain releases chemicals because some part of your brain is reacting as if you are in danger in some wayas far as finding yourself you may consider looking at what parts of each day you can control as a way to stay centered you could also focus on something that makes you feel happy andor comfortableyou may also consider the list of values here to give yourself an idea of what is most important to you what it is that you are living by now and what values you would prefer to live by httpwwwtherapistaidcomtherapyworksheetvaluesclarificationif this proves to be difficult consider seeing a local therapist,Depression

im depressed often and my mind goes a million miles a minute every once in a while things are okay for a few days after a bit i start noticing that i am picking at my skin profusely after roughly a week the anxiety is back and still picking sometimes i find myself causing fights to have change,hello and thank you for your question i am very sorry that you are struggling i have a few thoughts and perhaps some of my colleagues will add something else depression and anxiety can both be chronic conditions as you have experienced this means that they may always require treatment in order to have some kind of relief from them treatment could mean medication or some kind of counseling some people may take medication for the rest of their lives some people may go to counseling at times when the depression and anxiety worsens as you mentioned sometimes the symptoms improve for a little while but they can also come back when they do it is important to talk to your medical provider if you are getting medication andor to go back to your counselor and talk to them about the symptoms that have returned skin picking and some other behaviors are not uncommon for people who are experiencing something like anxiety many people report that they do this when they feel anxious and some say it calms them down it is not really a surprise that you are constantly trying to change things and even starting fights to do so these are ways to try to avoid escape and distract yourself from the feelings of anxiety and depression that is a very normal thing to do nobody likes these feelings and so distraction is something we naturally try in order to get rid of them the problem is that things like distraction and escape do not work as a longterm solution in fact they usually make things worse for many different reasons depression and anxiety can be treated but it is likely something you will need some help with i would recommend finding a counselor who has experience with anxiety and depression medication can be helpful but i still recommend counseling the reason for this is that the medication can help with symptoms while the counseling can address the symptoms and provide you with very helpful skills be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc,Depression

how do i make myself happy without the people who made me happy now that theyre gone i feel sad its been two months now but i seem to be unable to stay okay and independent,hello so someone made you happy but is no longer around i am sure that feels devastating as a counselor i usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external rather than the internal side of a persons life happiness is formed within ourselves all the external trappings of happiness are usually quite fleeting and temporary even relationships fo not last forever if we get to a place where we are reliant and dependent on those around us to create happiness in our lives then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves we are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy sometimes this entails working out issues that are holding us back from reaching a place of peace or resolution to a specific problemwhat i would offer to you is to find ways in which you can develop happiness for yourself what do you like about your life as it is right now what can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness these kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event mourning the loss of a social connection in whatever way that occurred is part of the grieving process but it is not permanent it is a path to healing and moving forward from this you can seek out new sources of happiness i encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world happiness is an expression of the internal feelings so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw if you are lacking in happiness then it becomes important to examine why that is and what you can do about it to promote selfcare seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the griefloss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supplyi wish you happiness for every day of your lifebest wishes,Depression

i feel like i am internally screaming all the time externally i am calm but i have this intense unidentifiable emotion constantly i dont feel sad i dont cry a lot i feel rather emotionally distant other than the internal screaming it kind of feels like im a caged animal,it is hard to make a definite diagnosis however i would say that it could be and or a combination of depression stress ptsd etc more background information would have to be needed one thing i would say is that you really need to seek guidance from a professional to work through these symptoms if what you described as a caged animal is released all the crying sadness and controllable emotions will come out that would not be good when they do get help before they do,Depression
i feel like i am internally screaming all the time externally i am calm but i have this intense unidentifiable emotion constantly i dont feel sad i dont cry a lot i feel rather emotionally distant other than the internal screaming it kind of feels like im a caged animal,as far as the formal diagnosis of depression goes it would be hard to determine without more information it sounds like you are noticing that there is a significant difference between how you are feeling on the inside and how you express yourself outwardly part of you is quite distressed and yet it remains invisible to the outside world almost as if it is trapped inside of your body many people who are depressed experience such things as intrusive thoughts emotional numbness difficulty expressing themselves and bodily tension caged animal in working with a competent therapist you may be able to get more insight into what you are going through the nature of the disconnect between you inner feelings and outer expression and eventually gain relief from the distress as well as a greater sense of connection with yourself and personal freedom,Depression
i feel like i am internally screaming all the time externally i am calm but i have this intense unidentifiable emotion constantly i dont feel sad i dont cry a lot i feel rather emotionally distant other than the internal screaming it kind of feels like im a caged animal,it sounds like you are trying to find a label to help you to understand why you are feeling the way you are feeling sometimes there are no labels for how we feel sometimes there is no name for the emotions that we are experiencing regardless you do not have to continue to feel this way no matter what you call it if you are seeking to experience an internal calmness such as your external calmness you may want to try some mindfulness practices or meditation however being able to get at the root cause of what you are feeling may be what you need to help you release this feeling for the long term i recommend seeking support for this to allow this internal screaming to get some air and begin to breathe,Depression
people who are parental figures in my life have in the past hurt me and some continue to do so it makes me feel like im not good enough for my husband or the life he provides me i have had jobs but i am going through a lot of my past garbage and trying to figure out when it all went wrong any time i bring these things up i am expected to be over the issue these are people that you cant just cut out but i have never received apologies for so much of my pain i dont know what to do any more i dont know who i am anymore,it sounds like you have been thinking about how past hurts have influenced you and when you try to talk about these hurts with people in your life you are feeling invalidated it also sounds like current conflicts are continuing to leave you feeling hurt and devalued in working with a therapist you may be able to get some clarity about your past who you are and what kinds of boundaries you want in your relationships so that you can lead a life that is more satisfying to you,Depression
people who are parental figures in my life have in the past hurt me and some continue to do so it makes me feel like im not good enough for my husband or the life he provides me i have had jobs but i am going through a lot of my past garbage and trying to figure out when it all went wrong any time i bring these things up i am expected to be over the issue these are people that you cant just cut out but i have never received apologies for so much of my pain i dont know what to do any more i dont know who i am anymore,hello adults who come from abusive home histories physical emotional or even psychological may take a long time to heal from that abuse we carry our past with us everywhere we go and it is up to us to find resolutions to past hurts this is often easier said than done but it is possible from the perspective of those with whom you have shared your concerns it might be assumed that based on where you are in life and who you are now that you have already worked through any issues from your younger years some of our deepest scars in life are indeed invisible and suppressed we have to get to the place where we can take care of the inner child that is still hurting by recognizing that those who hurt us  however they did might have had their own challenges which prevented them from functioning and behaving in ways we might have deeply needed those who have directly hurt you may not be capable of acknowledging and understanding how you were affected by their actions  even in the worst of cases they themselves may be doing what they can either out of shame or heartbreak for their own actions to work on forgetting how they behaved toward you all those years before how are they behaving toward you now can you find it in your heart to forgive those who have hurt you forgiveness is the gift we give ourselves and isnt dependent on an apology from an offender by forgiving even in the absence of any apology we are releasing the weight of the burden we are carrying that reflects the offense we feel was committed against us sometimes therapy can be helpful in this process talking with someone who can be nonjudgmental and reflects an empathetic position toward you might be what you need right now seeking out a therapist to help you work through these negatives feelings and thoughts is much easier than trying to go it alone i would encourage you to reach out and find someone who resonates with you on that journey so that you can begin a path toward healingwarm regardsshawn berthel ms lmhc,Depression

i am going through a very hard time and im so depressed my parents are getting a divorce and a lot of bad things are happening i want to lull myself,consider yourself quite normal for feeling overwhelmed and depressed about your parents divorce this is the most natural way to feel at this timedepending on how old you are and whether you live under their roof are dependent on their support and are either part of the decision or not of with whom and where you will live start considering these pointshow did you find out about the upcoming divorceare either of your parents reluctant to answer your questions or is it clear that neither of them want to talk about anything with youwhatever your fears and questions about your own future these are all real it is necessary for you to know about your basic futureif you are living on your own and the main problem is your inner adjustment that your family structure is completely changing then probably a good therapist would be a great help to you now to clarify these tensionssending lots of good wishes for an easy resolution to your new path,Depression
my depression has been reoccurring for a long time it all started when i was being bullied in high school in ninth grade my principal told me i needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates i needed professional help for my stress because i was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates after that i was fine for a couple of years i entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work i believe my depression rebooted from there with the stress i began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her obviously that wasnt the right choice i regret ever doing that seeing as even though im not selfharming anymore i always look back at that time whenever i feel very stressed i have a big problem with handling problems in life whenever a problem arises i get stressed and i feel hopeless as if its not going to get better i get way too stressed from my problems which leads to overreacting a lot especially when talking to others which then leads to depression i have a hard time coping with stress because i know that if i could handle it easily then i wouldnt be sad all the time and i would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones,i couldnt help but notice that you did not specify your age so i am unable to set the total chronological order and length that you have suffered in this way but i want to start by commending you on seeking out additional coping techniques on your own unfortunately it sounds like you were offered some that were more dangerous than helpful but be proud that you were able to curb those before they caused too much harm from what you have written stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage often when i am working with those who offer the same concern there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress when we are trying to make others happy especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper rules for success it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelming stress management is just that management of our own anxieties about the needs of others about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time each of these aspects requires a separate sets of tools to manage them accordingly for example assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties try to separate the different areas of the problem in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your lesshelpful responses to stress for example does a certain persons style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirementstry to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you,Depression
ive been depressed for quite a while ive been trying to work through it and my boyfriend has been my rock he is honestly the only person i trust enough to talk to about anything but he decided to break up with me because of my depression i cannot afford to see a therapist or anything so he saw no hope in staying with me my insurance has a  deductible so im screwed ive had everything from suicidal thoughts to trying to quit my job i have no one my family doesnt care about me they kicked me out when i turned  a few years ago i had friends but they have all moved on with their lives and have no time for me my exboyfriend is trying to help but is making things worse because every time i see or hear him i break down into tears i found out that i will never be promoted now because of my depression,it sounds like you have been struggling with this for quite some time using many of the same coping techniques that feel tried and true to no avail often we fall back on coping techniques that would be helpful in other problems stress social anxieties etc for our depression but the truth is that depression requires its own little tool kit depression is allencompassing and based on what youve written the symptoms are already affecting work and your personal life in myriad ways the best route forward would be to seek out counselling admittedly but if your insurance deductible is too high that can be very expensive i would recommend contacting your employee assistance program eap if offered by your employer if not you can look into community centres for counselling options check if your doctor will give you a referral or your local religious organization if however you are motivated to get your depression under control there are some great workbooks out there that you can use on your own or with your therapist as long as your therapist is trained in cognitive behavioural therapy or cbt such as mind over mood,Depression
i always feel like im doing something wrong everything i do is crappy i want to cry all the time i cant eat or sleep,you are describing some of the most common symptoms of depression low self esteem difficulty sleeping changes in appetite sad mood feelings of hopeless and feelings of worthlessness a full assessmentevaluation with a mental health professional is warranted to understand if indeed you meet criteria for a major depressive disorder ie are delressed one thing i often tell patients is that do you think you are depressed people often answer yes or no but many individuals respond with a question how would i know to that i often explain that if i stopped watching movies or better stopped enjoying watching movies that would be a clear indication for me that i am delressed it would be a sign that i have lost pleasure or interest in the activity that i typically enjoy most  ill ask you to think of one activity which you really really enjoy it could be anything from reading to being with friends to skiing to watching tv i would like to now ask you if you have stopped enjoying that activity or cant find the motivation to engage in it this is another symptom of depression loss in pleasurable activities the good news is that there are many effective available treatment if you are indeed in a depression or simply you want to modifydecrease your depressive symptoms ie you want to stop feeling so tired and so worthless treatment includes one or more of the following psychotherapy medication exercise any one or combination of both of these can help to improve your mood the even better news is that feeling that you are doing something wrong can diminish with appropriate treatment over time i hope you find this information helpful the most important next step is to get evaluated by a mental health professional typically a psychologist or psychiatrist and for both you and the professional to better understand your symptoms and your mood in the context of what is going on in your life,Depression
i no longer carry expressions on my face and my emotions are decreasing the more i have fights with my fiance,sometimes repressing anger can lead to depression and block all kinds of other emotions too i would wonder about your experience with anger and if youve ever been discouraged from expressing anger i would also wonder if you feel like you have space to express yourself in your relationship or if you feel like you really arent being heard its hard to feel cared for and connected to someone else when you dont feel accepted by them,Depression
i no longer carry expressions on my face and my emotions are decreasing the more i have fights with my fiance,sometimes when we fight a lot with our partner it becomes more uncomfortable to share emotions because it feels like it will lead to another flight or disagreementyou could try having a conversation when youre not fighting and starting it out by saying that you would like to discuss something important to you and see if your fiance is open to thatsomething else is that you could have an agreement that if one of you is having a really strong emotions in a difficult conversation and would like to break from the conversation you could agree ahead of time that youll say that you would like a timeout and will come back to discuss the issue in a certain amount of time usually about an hour and then try to resume the discussion the reason this can work is it can give you a chance to calm down and then still go back to the discussion rather than not talking about it again this only works if both of you agree to that before something starts though,Depression
im depressed i have been for years i hide it from everyone because im scared of the reactions ill get last time i tried telling my parents it was a huge argument about me being too young to be depressed im a legal adult calling me ungrateful and telling me that if i cant handle things now its only going to get worse in the future which is turning out to be true its exhausting pretending to be okay and i dont know how much longer i can try im just really tired and sadly i cant afford the help i need on my own,hi georgia theres a really good lesson here people tell us things and we tend to think thats the truthbut its not ill do some translating for youyoure so ungrateful means i need you to be successful and happy in order for me to feel im a good parentyoure too young to be depressed means i dont want to deal with your mental health issues right now ill pretend its not happening so i dont have to face my fear and shameits only going to get worse just means i dont know how to support you beyond scaring you into wanting to at least fake happiness for my sakeyour parents are being unsupportive not because youre not suffering but because this is all theyre capable of right now they are not where you will find the support you need so keep looking for it in other places its out there if might be an aunt or a friend or a friends aunt it might be a therapist or a bus driver or your family doctor keep looking for someone who will hear you i hope you dont ever give up,Depression

he said he would try and he never did its been nine months and this is making me worse today he said i have to respect whatever decision he makes is that true am i supposed to respect the decision to leave because he cant handle what im going through and leaves me here crying and worried every night hes constantly changing his mind on if he wants to work it out,wow that is tough there is nothing worse than fearing abandonment when you are already struggling with depression it sounds like you are still wanting to work through whatever challenges you and your husband are having but your husband may not be on the same page i would encourage you and your husband to seek professional support if you havent already while depression can put real strains on a relationship relationship problems can lead to or contribute to depression and there may be some real benefits to both of you in doing some couple therapy with that being said  if your husband is not willing to do therapy or is clear that he wants the relationship to end then i cant see what choice you have but to respect his decision as you mentioned this doesnt mean that you have to feel okay with the decision  as im sure you wouldnt  but ultimately loving one another and staying in committed relationships is a choice that we each have to make if he is wanting to leave  this could make things a lot tougher for you i would encourage you to seek professional support for yourself and reach out to lots of friends and family you do not need to face depression alone  nor should you have to we all need support at tough times like these,Depression

both of my parents committed suicide together and i was the one who found them i suffer from overwhelming depression which is having an extreme effect on me and my husbands sex lives he does not understand at all and is always making me feel so uncomfortable about sex,hello and thank you for your question first i want to tell you how sorry i am for the experience you had with your parents that is a grief and trauma that is certainly hard to imagine trauma and grief can affect us in many ways and certainly deeply personal things like our sex lives it may be difficult for others to make the connection but it is there so for example if stress and trauma make you feel like you are not interested in sex a partner may take it as a personal rejection rather than response to stress trauma or grief if your husband will agree to it couples counseling may be your best bet a counselor can help you with your communication and may be able to provide some education to your husband about trauma and how it can have an impact on intimacy if he doesnt agree to go it may be worth it to go on your own you still have a lot you are dealing with yourself and sometimes our personally therapy can influence others so it may be a good idea it is important to remember that even though you are married you have the right to make decisions about your body and that includes when you want to have sex with it i hope this is helpful and some of my colleagues may have ideas also be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc,Depression

im not the same anymore i dont know how to get back to who i am im sad and confused and angry and tired i dont sleep well,being tired can really affect almost everyones ability to work through things that make them sad confused or angry among other emotions if youre having difficulty sleeping try to get into a habit of going to bed and waking up close to the same time every day also consider only using the bed for sleeping so your brain knows that its time to sleep when you are in bed if you are not sleeping while you are in bed consider getting up and reading a book or doing something to make you tired before going back to bed hopefully youll be able to establish a patternsometimes sadness and other emotions make sleeping very difficult as well try keeping track of your moods to see what is leading up to the changesif youre still struggling consider talking with a therapist about the specifics andor maybe talking with your primary care physician there are natural sleep remedies that he or she may recommend for you,Depression
over the years i have slowly lost everything my jobs my cars my freedom and my money i am a stayathome mom who doesnt make any money doesnt have a car never goes out and cleans all day long everyday,there are an infinite number of possibilities here you included a lot of things that you dont have is there anyway that you can have some freedom for a few hours a week at least a lot of times stay at home moms have groups when they meet at different public places where their children can play together and they can talk together i dont know how old your child or children isare but perhaps going back to work is something that can happen in the futurei wonder if you may consider who you have in your life who can support you i dont know whether you have a spouse or parents or siblings who could help out with some different things i wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted if you can sort out some possible answers to that maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happenalso again depending on the age of your children some parents can do things while the children are sleeping even if you are in the same room for example if your children are sleeping for about two hours maybe 30 minutes of that could be reserved for you and the rest could be for cleaning or other things you need to do,Depression

i started having anxiety three months ago im new to having anxiety and its making me depressed,i agree with cory acceptance and commitment therapy act does seem to help a lot of people who struggle with anxiety its not the only type of therapy that can help but it seems to help people in a way that is more natural and realistic as cory mentioned anxiety is something that is part of life so therapies that indicate we can get rid of it are questionable our natural inclination when we have anxiety is to stop any and all things that may cause it or provoke it we do this because we think it will help but it actually doesnt anxiety usually has us rehashing the past or rehearsing the future while ignoring the present act helps folks who have those kinds of tendencies be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc,Depression
i started having anxiety three months ago im new to having anxiety and its making me depressed,as a past sufferer of anxiety myself i have learned that it is a natural part of life it is a natural part of us the longer we try to run from it the more it entangles us in its clutches if we deny certain parts of ourselves we will become depressed or even oppressed the only way to deal with anxiety is to embrace it and accept it and in fighting the fight without fighting we will eventually win i would encourage you to look into acceptance and commitment therapy your answer i think lies in that area of research hope this helpsc,Depression
i have no friends no hobbies and no interest in anything i get annoyed with everything and everyone i am always tired i can sleep  hrs or  hrs and im still tired i dont know what to do is this normal,hello and thank you for your question it certainly sounds like you dont like how things are going here are a few thoughts and ideas1 if you havent seen a primary care provider in a while you may want to there are health conditions that can affect your mood and energy levels even at your age it doesnt hurt to get checked out if they find the cause they may be able to treat it and improve the symptoms in addition most primary care providers are trained to be able to manage medication for patients who have mild moderate and sometimes severe depression so dont be surprised if your primary care doctor offers to put you on an antidepressant if they diagnose you with depression medication is not the only way to treat depression but sometimes it is necessary depending on different factors2 you may want to consider counseling since it is another effective way to treat depression a counselor will help you explore the factors that may be leading to depressive symptoms in the first place this could include thoughts behaviors beliefs life experiences and other things 3 finally to answer your question about whether these feelings are normal these symptoms could be the sign of an underlying general health or mental health condition it is important to remember that even if these symptoms are abnormal it doesnt mean that you are millions of people struggle with depression so remember the symptoms are the problem not you hope this helps be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc,Depression
i have a lot on my mind but all i want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone why do i feel so alone,it has been said that depression is often the result of a blocked goal often people struggle with both anxiety and depression but have difficulty determining which is the most important issue for some depression is the result of frequently blocked goals and when their predominant issues are evaluated they discover that they are anxious worried about a lot of areas in their life but seem to find no relief when there is no relief and there have been numerous attempts either in their mind or in practical application to resolve the anxiety depression is often the result in this type of case depression is not the main or underlying issue the anxiety is the underlying issue having a lot on my mind sounds like anxiety unresolved anxiety can lead to feelings of depression which are often associated with emptiness in the question above i would want to evaluate all of the issues surrounding having a lot on my mind and determine where these might be coming from has there been ongoing rejection from peers from family if so why does this seem to be happening isolation is often a protective measure that one implements to avoid further pain where does that need to protect originate are there unmet needs from childhood are there traumatic life events that have created a need to selfprotect as a defense mechanism we can feel alone even when in a crow of people or at a party this has nothing in this case to do with being around people it has more to do with how we view ourselves if there is a prevailing message or script that has been internalized that says you are worth nothing or you dont deserve the company of others then being around people will not alleviate the problem but only exacerbate it i would want to evaluate how one feels about themselves and what negative messages one has received and has repeated to oneself over time the developmental needs meeting strategy is a therapy aimed at addressing unmet childhood needs if there is specific trauma that is associated with socializing with people then emdr can be very helpful in desensitizing and reprocessing the trauma looking at whether this individuals issue with emptiness is straight depression or whether it is depression as a result of unresolved anxiety is key to determining a treatment strategy,Depression
i have a lot on my mind but all i want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone why do i feel so alone,there are many possible issues to consider as depression social anxieties even medical illness for some even grief creates a sense of isolation pains from relationship break up also obsessive thinking can be debilitating seeking at least one trusted friend or family member can be a start towards increased personal support some persons may simply feel connected by spending time with someone as this even if not talking directly on issues just being around another is positive obviously there is more to explore on this question given minimal information from two sentences,Depression
i have a lot on my mind but all i want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone why do i feel so alone,there is a difference in someone agreeing to try something and agreeing to continue to do it have you ever been willing to try something and then decided you did not like it a type of food a sport a new restaurant a type of dance so this does not mean that things have changed between you it does mean that the two of you may need to spend some time to find out what you both like instead of looking at it as a rejection look at it as a challenge an adventure that the two of you can go on as explorers together some couples have even found it helpful to each write down ten things they would like the other person to try and then each person can pick three things from the other persons list to add into their life together when they chose to over the next few weeks,Depression

i always see the worst end of things my boyfriend and i arent talking and i swear hes leaving me i keep failing my road test and i see my future crumble i have no desire for friends i pushed my best friend away after christmas and i have no desire to fix it or make new friends my aunt died and i cry all the time even if i burn my lunch,i really love that youre taking responsibility for your pessimism here theres a modern parable about two young brothers one child is in a room full of every toy you could imagine and hes miserable the other is in a room full of horse manure and hes flinging it around with joy so then someone comes and asks the first boy why hes so miserable because he has so much he says that hes missing the one toy that he really wants then the brother is asked why hes so happy in a room full of manure and he says with all this sht theres gotta be a pony in here somewherehappiness is a state of mind and i hear you saying that you used to be happy so maybe this means you believe its possible thats a wonderful startresearch on depression shows us that it is very linked to pessimism you say i always see the worst end of things thats pessimism life is like an elephant if all you see is roughness backup and walk around the view will change the key to optimism is to build your ability to see the bad things in life as 1 temporary this will pass i know how to fix friendships 2 specific not involving the whole of your life and 3 not your fault tons of people fail road tests on the flip side it helps if we can see good things as 1 more permanent 2 bleeding into other areas of our lives and 3 something you created not taking credit for good things and blaming yourself for the bad ones is typical especially of women the feelings you are having are temporary youre in a slump and its a good time to sit down and look at how you can make the picture look different i think you know how but you lack energy right now if tackling this on your own isnt enough a therapist can help you take that step back to look at the big picture and help you rebuild your natural resilience and capacity for joy i wish you the best,Depression
i was anxious to go to middle school i was afraid of what people might say about me so when school started i wasnt acting like myself i was quiet which im usually not i didnt talk to anybody and didnt have any friends then a few years later my grandma died i really became depressed and stop going to school for a little i hated myself and still do i just need help i need someone to care for me i need someone to show that they care,i agree you need more care and support no one deserves to feel alone or like they hate themselves were all wonderful imperfect complicated people and were at our best when were all helping each other im glad you wrote this question because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes i can tell that youre smart because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connectedyou not being yourself and then how you felt when your grandma died when grandma died you needed and deserved extra love and support but the people around you didnt seem to give it to you maybe my hunch is that they wanted to but that they didnt know how much you needed it or what you needed exactly the older you get the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature but thats how it works when you started middle school it sounds like you changed you got more quiet right that must have felt weird to not be acting like yourself it sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldnt like you fear can be silly so then fear got you to not show yourself and when we dont show ourselves people cant see who we are they dont know us as well and then they dont know what we need and they cant care for us as well either fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you it does that to a lot of us so where youre at right now is because of what fear did to you and also because when grandma died you were already isolated so people couldnt see your pain and know that you needed support theres a simple solution but youd have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say get off my back youre not helping me by telling me lies can you be brave enough to go back to your old louder self if you talk to the people closest to youtell them what you think and how you feel then theyll be able to give you the care that you want and deserve i wish you well as you try this,Depression
i was in a situation with a guy hes my brothers friend and kind of like a brother to me he invited me over to hang out and then came on to me i was instantly terrified to say no and i gave in i dont know whats wrong with me i cant figure out why im afraid to say no this is giving me a lot of guilt and depression,hi tennessee there is nothing wrong with you there are many good reasons why you didnt say no you didnt say no because you were caught off guard and unprepared there is no place in life that teaches girls or boys how to manage it when someone crashes a sexual boundary you also live in a culture where girls are encouraged to be cooperative and not upset people and to put the needs of other people first you instinctively want people to like you and people can be very coercive sexually you said it yourself you gave in he wore you downtheres nothing wrong with you it wasnt your job to say no women arent the gatekeepers of male sexual urges it was his job to get your consent first he pressured you into it a good therapist would help you to dig deep and uncover all these barriers to saying no and more if you said no what might happen then what might that mean about you what are you avoiding feeling unloved unwanted cold what would you have to believe in order to be confident enough to say no that you didnt have to do anything you dont want to do that youre special or that sexuality is special would you need a better understanding of what sexual assault is i love that you want to do some work here to strengthen your sexual boundaries and i urge a widespread conversation about what consent it men and women of all ages could use more of this training,Depression

my life is completely normal yet i feel empty inside i feel as if i already know why im alive to reproduce and die,are there any times or moments in which you feel other than empty start with knowing the context of when you feel something other than emptyif there is no recent example then in your mind go back in time to think of when you felt something other than empty recall what you liked about this time whether you were by yourself or with others what type of activity you were involved at the time of nonemptinesshow did you come to your conclusion that your life purpose is to reproduce and die if this is what your parents siblings and extended family believe it is possible that you have a broader view of yourself and havent yet uncovered a way of defining your own philosophy of livinggive yourself the time to browse around online or in person social meet ups on your interests it is possible you will discover entire new areas of life and ways of considering life that are brand new to you and which connect to your true selfthis is one way of respecting your individuality which of itself may decrease your sense of emptiness,Depression

im almost never happy half of the time i dont feel anything i find it easy to make myself feel nothing i know i push people away because its easier i just want answers im sick of feeling this way its ruining my relationships with people,hi loyal this is a common question i suggest that you not diagnose yourself only a physician can do that but the symptoms you mention are certainly common signs of depression rarely happy emotional numbness hopelessness isolation depression is very common research suggests that one in three people may experience it in their lifetime and at any one point ten percent of adults may be experiencing it most therapists are very good at spotting the signs and treating accordingly although only a physician can prescribe medicationthe great news is that depression is treatable some people experiencing depression may benefit from medication often to lift the heaviness of the illness enough so that one can focus on psychotherapy and therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy and behavioural activation therapy have demonstrated a clear ability to reduce symptoms of depression even if medication helps seeing a therapist to look at the roots of your depression and to build coping skills is very important a qualified therapist will help you look at the barriers to happiness in your specific case and suggest a course of treatment you are not alone and you dont have to suffer keep asking questions and you will find your answers,Depression
my husband and i are in a terrible place part of me wants to fix it but then im caught up with not knowing how and not being able to communicate my feelings to him because he always feels im blaming him sometimes i am because the feelings of distrust are so strong i feel they must be coming from something hes doing but sometimes i know im being irrational still that doesnt stop the anxiety the other half of the time i just want to walk away but i feel like that will only be a temporary fix,you may be pressuring yourself to be the one person who fixes the relationship this is impossible because the relationship belongs to both of youhas he told you whether he feels about himself that how he interacts with you is contributing to problems in the coupleis he willing to understand what youre asking of him without shutting down with whatever he is feeling when he feels blamedyour feelings of distrust are the natural outcome of not being properly heard and understood hes not willing to listen to you so of course youre frustrated and this frustration comes out in all sorts of uneasy feelingswillingness to hear each other in a nondefensive way sometimes requires a couples therapists assistanceask your husband if hes willing to understand not judge you be willing yourself to do the sameif after trying and getting nowhere youll know when to stop trying on your own as a couple and to find a specifically trained couples therapistswarning not all therapists are trained to do couples therapy ask the therapist if theyve had specialized training in couples therapyotherwise having a referee type therapy session of what do you think what do you think isnt going to do anything except frustrate both of you furthergood luck,Depression
they dont go away and i feel like im going crazy does that ever stop can it be a symptom of medication,since you realize that hearing voices in your head is not usual for you then definitely there is a problematic situation happening within your awareness of who you areif you recently started taking a new drug or increased dosage of one you already were taking and the voices started shortly after then yes it is possible medication created your problemstart by telling whoever gave you the presecription about the problem youre havingcrazy has some flexibility as to whether someone is this way or notcertainly a very positive sign that youre not crazy is that youre selfaware of a problem within yourself and youre responsible toward yourself and making effort to address this problemcrazy people usually dont do responsible behaviors,Depression

a girl and i were madly in love we dated for over a year and were even talking about marriage and future plans together she moved away for school and we attempted a long distance relationship we eventually broke up its been a year now and i still havent lost my feelings for her i still love her the same way i did ive suffered from depression ever since the breakup and have been unable to connect with anyone else its damaging me and my life,hi boise im sorry that youve lost this love the fact that you were planning marriage and a future tells me that you meant something very special to each other at that time its different nowyoure not together anymore but you cant accept this right good for you for identifying that this situation is damaging your life youve been grieving for longer than you were together oh but really youve not been grievingyoure stuck still loving her instead of moving forward unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache lets look at some possible blocks to moving forwardit could be that theres something unfinished for you maybe you felt hurt and you didnt have the chance to say so or you felt you hurt her and you didnt have the chance to make it right maybe theres a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say maybe you want to tell her youve never stopped loving her and see if she feels the same way if this is the case you have two choices right you can reach out and say what you need to say or you can stop ruminating on that question and let it go if you reach out theres no guarantee it will go well or that shell even respond maybe write her a letter and dont send it or send itit might be worth the risk use the next paragraph to help you decide do you know how she feels how did it end did she end it was it ended just because of the distance or are there more differences between you that didnt work sometimes people are so in love that they cant clearly see that the other person isnt in love with them anymore use the information you have about what she wants for her lifecan you honour what she says she needs if shes asked for distance you would do well to honour thata key to moving forward look at your thoughts and where theyre getting stuck write it down what bad thing can happen if you let it go or if i move forward that will mean keep goingwhat would be the worst part of that this kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck placeit is possible that youve turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future as in if this person doesnt love me then im unlovable or no one will ever love me as much as she did so your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future can you find another way to reject that message try saying these things to yourselfi know she loved me there is evidence of thati was a good partner there is evidence of thatits part of life to fall in love and then have to move forwardi can do this and learn from itmany people like methats how i know im lovableits normal to feel sad im grieving a lost lovei want to move forward and not stare in the rearview mirrori know more love awaits me if i can get fear out of the wayif this person loved me others can too but not if im clinging to some old memorythese are the kinds of things a therapist would explore with you i wish you well,Depression
ive got so much anger i dont know how to control myself my girlfriend screams at me all the time and sometime i dont know how to deal with life im very depressed and angry i feel lost,hi campbell river you say you have anger but you dont mention how it shows or maybe it doesnt are you aggressive with your girlfriend since you mention depression i wonder if youre bottling it all up somewhere instead of letting it show at all if this is the case i admire your ability to not lash out at someone whos hurting you however if they are totally unexpressed anger turn inward and shift into depression when she yells at you what do you do is this the moment that you feel the most angry i wouldnt be surprised anger is a normal response to someone yelling at you something about angerits often there to cover up our more vulnerable emotions under the anger i wonder if you feel worthless powerless scared unloved part of the trick to reducing anger is identifying those other emotions and expressing them you say you dont know how to deal with life and i think maybe you mean you dont know how to deal with emotions lots of people dont this is confusing for most of us what am i feeling why is it so strong im afraid to express it for fear of hurting someone or falling apart or feeling alone how do i know what to express and what to be quiet about these are all great questions to ask yourself and a qualified therapist can help you sort it all out and support you in your growth i wish you well,Depression
ive been having this ongoing problem for most of my life now i am a young adult and right now driving and even being a passenger gives me terrible panic attacks and anxiety i cant ride in the backseat or the front seat with the safety belt on i have to lean the seat back a bit because the pressure on my back terrifies me i miss so many opportunities to go places with friends and family because of my fears of having a panic attack my family offers little to no support they think its fake or all in my head it makes me feel guilty and at times depressed to the point where id rather never wake up anymore i am not selfharming i just feel meaningless this constant fear has taken over my thoughts and my life i was such a happy person i want my life back i want to travel with my friends and family again but i dont know how ive almost given up hope on getting better and just accepting the fact that ill live with this anxiety forever,not having support from your family for such a significant problem is a problem itselfhow about your friends are any of them nurturing or treat you kindly when you bring up that youve got this problemare any of your friends willing to accommodate the fact that right now youve got panic attacks from driving and being a passengermaybe being and feeling accepted while youre in this current phase of your life would help diminish the panic attacksif no support is coming to you then a next step would be to evaluate the relationships in your life and to develop standards and expectations of others especially that they are considerate of your great need at this timeits possible you are bearing the emotional burden of a lot more people in your life than yourselfif no one wants to show they care about this situation then release yourself from trying to please and satisfy everyones wish that you be better while they ignore your need for their supportbe realistic in what youre able to give back to people who want to be blind to your emotional needthinking this way will at first raise your anxiety level from fear of losing everyone eventually youll stabilize within yourself and know that all youre asking for is some support for having a tough time hopefully the others will be more responsive to youif they dont you still know that youre being reasonable for what youd like,Depression

i dont know how to have emotions i never had any from my birth being human i think of myself as a monster i enjoy pain i cut myself for my climax during sex i think most of the time i lie even when sometimes it would have been easy just to tell the truth i was in rehabilitation for four year i have made love with both men and women but it made no impact in my emotions the books that i enjoy reading hp lovecraft and edgar allen poe i go hunting every saturday i feel powerful i dont enjoy the killing of the creature but the hunt of it and to eat and drink the flesh and blood of the creature,im not sure that you dont feel emotion or that you are frightened of the depth of your emotions from what you write the context of your growing up years had people telling you to not feel little kids and babies dont remember whether or not they had emotions since birth this is information someone told you or was part of your family systempossibly your family was afraid of their emotions or of you knowing yourssimilarly your comparison of being human means being monster like is not an obvious connection besides monsters are an idea they arent real they embody what someone considers the worst qualities of themselves or the human species again i wonder whether youve taken on stories you heard growing up about how unacceptable and bad you area way to start learning your emotions is to start in simple basic ways to ask yourself what you are feeling in the situations that you believe emotions would belongif on the first bright sunny and warm day of the year you remind yourself to notice what youre feeling in response to this youll be taking one step toward awareness of your emotionsif someone buys you a birthday present be aware of how you feel keep adding awareness to situations and see if this builds an ease with feeling emotions,Depression
i am on my own with my daughter i am so worried and stressed about her,your instinct to help your daughter is naturalhow you proceed depends a lot on whether she recognizes she has a psychological and emotional problem or if only you see this from observing heralso her age matters a lot in what way would be most likely to succeed in addressing the problems you describeif you and your daughter have different opinions as to whether or not she has problems and she is above the legal age of when you have authority over her life then you can only suggest to her that therapy may benefit herif your daughter is in your legal control then you can locate a counselor nearby discuss your situation with that person and depending on the outcome youd be within your parenting right to take your daughter to a counselorstarting therapy without willingness to do so is risky the person may feel resentful enough to not participate and sometimes the counselor is skillful enough to find a path to your daughter or any patients selfinterest and engage them in therapyfamily counseling regardless of your daughters age is another way to bring your concerns to your daughters attention in a therapy environment in which a counselor would be able to help distinguish the seriousness of your daughters psychological problem from simply a difference in viewpoints between you and your daughter in how to handle certain situationsalso if you believe your daughter is a threat to herself then instead of this slower route get in touch with the emergency psychological assessment service in your town for a more immediate response,Depression
i just had a newborn when i brought him home my mom told me to leave now im in a womens home i dont see my boyfriend that often because he works the womens place is helping me find an apartment so i can go back to work and get child care,congrats on the birth of your sonwas your moms request for you to leave her house one which she asked awhile ago or was this her greeting when you walked in the doormy question is whether your mom had some changed circumstance in her life whether she and you discussed living arrangements prior to your sons birth or whether nothing was talked about you assumed youd be living with her she assumed you wouldnt and the two of you didnt speak to one another about any of thisdepending on the answers there may be clues as to handling future expectations of others especially your momfrom what you write the womens home is supportive of your basic daily living needs it is good news that the people who run this home know and offer community resourcesin your interactions with the staff of the womens home ask all the questions necessary so youll have a clear understanding of the apartment lease anything at all that is on your mind about becoming employed and finding childcarethe point is to have all the major steps youre about to start addressedthis way youll be minimizing the possibility of any sudden bad news by the womens home told to yousending lots of good luck,Depression
i have experienced cycles of depression for the past four years and it hits me harder every time it comes back this past time it was extremely debilitating so i went on wellbutrin i could feel the effects of the medicine after the first week a month and a half later i decided that my depression was being caused by my own unwillingness to move forward and address my behaviors and thoughts that were keeping me in a place of despair i became worried that the medicine was making me complacent and prohibiting me from working out what i needed to in my life to bring back true fulfillment i stopped taking it a month ago and feel okay a lot of the anxiety it was paired with has gone away however i still dont feel my sense of self has been completely regained and i have days where i feel a zombielike haze of having no interests or the ability to fully concentrate on anything is it better to continue letting time and good habits work out the remaining depression or should i go back on the medicine,deciding whether or not psychiatric medicine is a good option can be complicated as you have noticed and only a person who is licensed to prescribe can give you medical advice regarding medications while there is sometimes relief from symptoms from medication as you have pointed out there are often negative side effects as well while i cant give you advice on whether or not to continue medication i would urge you to take an inventory of the positive and negative effects that you have noticed and educate yourself as much as possible about the short and longterm costs and benefits of psychiatric medication if you can find a doctor psychiatrist or arnp who is competent in mental health it may also benefit you to consult with themone thing that i am wondering about is what is your support system like in regards to your fight against depression are you seeing a therapist or attending any therapeutic or supportive group while there are many things that one can do on their own to work through challenges such as depression psychotherapy has been shown time and again in research to be highly effective and sometimes having a relationship with a caring competent professional who understands depression and ways of helping can make a huge difference,Depression
at school it feels like ive lost all my friends and ive been really weird with my sleeping patterns i used to cut myself and i really want to again but i change in the locker rooms because i dont want anybody to see i get ticked off easy and overreact at night im very depressed and listen to sad music and all that sort of stuff please help me i just want to be happy again and i feel like im starting to fake a smile at school,as silly as it may sound making sure that we are getting the right amount of restful sleep is very important when we are feeling low the reason for this is the lack of proper sleep significantly affects our ability to problem solve and critically evaluate our situation and can lead to a domino effect in our thinking i know you feel that you may be losing your friendships but what are the facts that have led to this belief really ask yourself are they facts or are they your perspective on events in regards to your coping behaviours at night it sounds very isolating and also very silenced as opposed to the sad music why not try all music allowing yourself to experience the wide breadth of emotions that are circling within you one of the other recommendations i would make would be to try and journal about some of those thoughts and fears in order to release them in a positively cathartic way some of the behaviours that you have mentioned are a bit more significant though and i would recommend speaking with someone directly in the near future,Depression
i think about death all the time because i feel so alone i want someone to love and someone to love me,feeling alone andor isolated is almost always associated with being depressed as humans we need connection and interaction with others in order to feel satisfied given that you are frequently thinking about death i highly recommend that you see a mental health professional as soon as possible to help assess your immediate needs and address any underlying issues that may be contributing to your feelings of loneliness and depression the good news is that with proper consistent treatment and commitment to change things can really turn around for you a therapist can work with you on building enjoyable activities into your daily routine change maladaptive thought patterns that contribute to your sadness and help with exploring what has gotten you to where you are by learning about where your sadness originates engaging in preferred activities and changing your thought patterns you should begin feeling relief from the burden of depression what will likely result is further opportunity to find social outlets and an increased ability to connect with others dont give up create some short terms goals that you can likely achieve and make your treatment a priority and a focus you have already taken the first step in getting better by writing to this site keep on this path and believe in yourself best of luck to you,Depression

my fiance suffers from severe anxiety and depression she has had it most of her life her anxiety in public places is the worst it gets to points where she cant breathe or move sometimes she wont even go to the restroom so she will hold in her pee until her stomach hurts or she pees herself she curls up in corners at the mall and has panic attacks she wont eat or drink in public if she isnt having a panic attack or crying shes clinging to me and avoiding everything and everyone her depression flares up out of nowhere and causes her to become very suicidal and selfharming she get really sick from anxiety and scared to the point that i cant even get her to eat drink leave the bed or go outside she always tells me how she grew up around so much fighting and fear that it makes her scared of loud sounds yelling conflict and even talking to strangers in public she will refuse to go to a store unless i am with her to talk to the cashier for her she is so scared that i cant even get her to drive she doesnt want to get her license because shes scared of trying to drive some people have recommended medication but i believe its just going to cover up her illness and not solve it i dont want my fiance pumped with drugs i believe a psychiatric service dog would be the best bet for her when we first met my poodle it would calm her down a lot she took the dog out every time we went out and she seemed much calmer and happier she slowly would eat and the dog seemed to make her feel a lot better i am worried and want to help her without medication,it sounds like you have been a positive support for your fiancee there is no doubt that this situation is a great challenge for the both of you while it may feel like you are responsible for her health and happiness it is important that you understand that you on your own wont be able to resolve her mental health issues based on what you have explained it sounds like she needs to get a medical andor psychiatric evaluation whether or not she decides to take medication is her and your decision but keeping an open mind about treatment options is important i suggest that she see a therapist on her own in order to better understand and cope with her anxiety and depression especially given her suicidal thoughts you would also likely benefit from therapy individual or couples therapy in order to address how you are feeling and best learn how to support her and your relationship i wish the very best for both of you and hope that things will improve sooner than later,Depression

im supposed to stay here the rest of my academic life but ive never liked it here not even before i came ive never felt like i belong ive missed my country every second in the past four months and im just miserable im gaining weight doing nothing and crying for hours straight is it time to go back home or is it just culture shock,it sounds like you are feeling very unsure and out of place and the prospect of continuing to feel as you do now for the remainder of schooling seems daunting without getting to know more about you and your experiences here and at home it is hard to say what you should do however i think exploring these things with a competent therapist may help you to discover the answer,Depression
i am in high school and have been facing anxiety issues lately whenever i get close to being in a relationship some kind of anxiety takes over and keeps me from the relationship this anxiety causes me depression at times and even makes me want to vomit while a semirelationship should be joyous for me its an emotional nightmare i cant get to the bottom of ive had this before and had to leave the semirelationship to avoid throwing up every time i made contact with my crush what could be the reason behind this is it massive nerve problems is it a fear of a bad relationship while im not quite ready to be in one anyway i want to get to the bottom of this for a brighter future in which i can be in one i dont take medications and have no desire to i have read forums and ive talked about the issue with my sister who has faced similar problems,hi helenai felt a bit sad when i read this this is a new term for me semirelationship what does it mean i know that todays culture for young people is more of a hookup culture than a dating one maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore that makes me feel sad i hear a lot of young women im not sure youre female but thats my guess say that they struggle with hookups because they cant let themselves hope for a phone call after a hookup research tells us that after a hookup college age women tend to feel used and unworthy and men tend to feel guilty i think this scenario works better for men than women but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the endthis is only one possible explanation for your anxietythat your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether its okay to want or expect thatmaybe take a moment and listen to anxiety anxiety tends to try to convince us that somethings wrong with us or something bads going to happen anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague its more difficult to refute it then but you can try to clarify its whisperings by asking yourself these questions what am i afraid of what is the worst thing that might happen here then what might happen and what would be the worst part of that keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen might someone not want youmight you feel rejectedor feel not good enoughyou might get hurtthen when you find that core fear you can look at your life and i bet youd find a place where that idea or fear originated a big moment or many smaller ones when you actually did feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt in the end its a feeling youre trying to avoid not life or relationship and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious but this doesnt work for you good with the help of a qualified therapist you can learn to talk back to anxiety and move forward in life and love with calm confidence,Depression
i just got out of a two year relationship i broke up with my boyfriend because he wasnt showing any affection at all he was talking to other women and lying about it it pushed me away and hurt me but im still in love with him a couple days after our breakup he was talking to someone new he told me he wasnt sure if he loved me i cried for several days lost my appetite and couldnt sleep our whole relationship was only us we didnt have friends it was me and him against the world we didnt talk to anyone else because we only wanted to talk to each other we hung out constantly and skyped to sleep every single night then when i cut myself we talked on skype he cried and told me im still in love with you i never stopped loving you and i cried tears of joy i asked multiple times if he loved me and asked to make sure he wasnt just saying that because of me being so depressed he promised and assured me he loved me he came over after that and we had sex because he wanted to he went the home that night and told me he didnt love me and he lied because he was scared he told me i wasnt attractive i wasnt beautiful to him and that i changed he also told me he was  sure hed never love me again im still in love with him why do i love him how do i stop just knowing that someone else is with him hurts me that i wasnt good enough and that im no longer beautiful hurts me i think i need a therapist but dont know if i should,i am very sorry for the pain you are suffering losing the most significant person in your life is extremely painful and breakups are often equated to a death there will certainly be a grieving process that you go through and time passing will allow the hurt to subside with that being said seeing a therapist is highly recommended as it sounds like continuous support may be necessary for healing to take place anytime sadness causes thoughts of suicide or self harm it is important to get help immediately a therapist can help you by validating your feelings and what you are going through while also working with you to move through the grieving process adopt new hobbies social outlets and goals for your future while starting over and trying out new ways of being may seem like a daunting task it will only make things easier and give you a sense of hope and purpose for your future with the new year right around the corner this could be viewed as a good time and opportunity to get reaquainted with yourself and set goals related to living a more fullfilling life hang in there with a support system in place and a healthy mindset things can only get easier best of luck to you,Depression

my last relationships have ended horribly they just up and abandoned me one of them i have never gotten closure with over it leaving me emotionally wrecked i know somethings wrong with me but i dont know how to even start trying to better myself i get into these depressed like states whenever anyone i care about is too busy to be with me i know that i shouldnt act like that because people are genuinely busy but i feel like theyre doing it just because they dont want to be around me,frequently when working with clients i utilize the abc model developed by albert ellis the founder of rational emotive behavior theory the theory basically states that you can not control an event but you can control your reaction to the emotions associated with said event for instance here is an examplea action or event you need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you backb behavior or response you begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or i am not important to this personc consequence you feel depressedif you look at the model b has a direct effect on c the thought is if you change your reaction to a then c will have a better consequence such asa stays the sameb this is what you change this person must be busy they will call me back when they get a chance or i can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is availablec decreased feelings of depression  overall functioning improvesthis is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve if this model resonates with you i recommend feeling better getting better staying better by alber ellis in addition looking for support groups in your area are a great source of support when you are feeling abandoned or alone,Depression

ive have lived for sometime with depression but things have gotten a lot better but why is it so hard to get over anxiety and social isolation,the best way to handle depression and anxiety is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor and therapy to help you understand the thoughts feelings and behaviors that are causing the depression and anxiety in the first place and then to replace these with more positive thoughts and behaviors this is not something that anyone should just white knuckle and try to get through on their own with no help cognitive behavioral therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety this takes a therapist trained in cbt there are some things in life that you cannot change and must learn to accept a lot of people spend time trying to change things that they have no control over this may be the behavior of someone else in your life or it could be a situation that you cannot change such as the recent death of a loved one a lost relationship or an accident or illness which has left you handicapped in cases like this what can change is your attitude and thoughts about the situation that you now find yourself in one thing that is inevitable about life is that stuff happens and it is not always pleasant some people take these unpleasant occurrences very hard and it throws them into a deep depression other people seem to be able to handle lifes ups and downs and bounce back they do this with having positive coping skills in their life learning new coping skills is something your therapist can help you witha lot of people are so focused on trying to change the things in their life that they cannot change and are ignoring the things that they can change there are things that you can do here is a quote for you to consider you are getting almost everything that you are getting based on the choices that you have made you will continue to get the same thing out of life until you make some changes another quote i like is you will find a way or you will find an excuse dont ever say that you have no choice everyone has a choice you might not particularly like any of the choices that you are facing but you do have choices not happy in a relationship you can leave it hate your job get a new one if it matters to you you will find a way dont sit there complaining about everything but not doing anything different or bettertake care of yourself exercise is very important not only for your physical health but for your mental health as well eating right and exercising will help you feel better about yourself also find a meditation that works for you there are progressive muscle relaxation exercises visual and mental meditations and many many more start making some positive changes in your life today you can do it,Depression

i start counselingtherapy in a few days im freaking out but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about,hi there  as someone who has practiced as a clinical psychologist for 25 years  i would say that crying is nothing to worry about at all  almost every single person i have worked with has cried at one point or another starting therapy takes a lot of courage when you work with a therapist once you feel safe  you talk about a lot of very private and potentially emotional things that you may have never discussed with anyone before i have seen people cry with sadness  cry with relief at releasing painful things they have held onto for a long time cry because they feel so relieved that they finally feel heard i myself have sometimes cried with clients because some things they talk about are so profoundly moving i can assure you that most  if not all  therapists expect clients to cry and there is nothing to be embarrassed about crying can be very cathartic and can allow us to release a lot of painful feelings we have been stuffing down crying is often a sign that you are really working things through and getting in touch with feelings that you need to get in touch with in order to heal so  to summarize  dont worry at all about crying it will probably feel uncomfortable at first  but i promise you  you will not be judged for crying in therapy and it will be less embarrassing once it happens a time or two and you are assured that your therapist will be there for you and wont judge you good luck,Anxiety

ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,hi there thank you for your question its absolutely ok to feel nervous going to therapy i have experienced anxiety going to see my own therapist there can be a few reasons why you might feel this way first it is always unnerving to see a person who is a stranger and to share intimate things with that stranger you mentioned it has only been a couple of sessions your anxiety might subside as you continue to see your therapist and grow more comfortable with himher another reason why you might feel particularly nervous is perhaps you are not comfortable sharing things as children we might have bad experiences opening up to others someone might bully or ridicule us and that experience can stay with us for a long time making it extra scary to share our intimate feelings and thoughts with others if this the case as you continue with your sessions and have positive interactions with your therapists this anxiety will subside with time and you will relearn that it is safe to share and the last thought why you might feel the shakes is perhaps you know that you need to talk about some past experiences or memories that are uncomfortable and difficult regardless of the reason it might help you to bring up your nervousness in your session and share how you feel with your therapist having an open dialogue about your anxiety with your therapist can help you resolve some of that anxiety and built greater trust with your therapist,Anxiety
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,hello there you ask about being nervous and shaky walking in to your therapy session and want to know if its normal  i realize there a few ways to look at this i presume you werent anticipating feeling this way and probably hoped to feel the opposite well my initial response is yes sure it can be within reason to feel this way have you been in therapy before is this somewhat new that could be part of the reason but either way new or not i think when are entering into a meeting that holds potential evaluation of deep things about you and your heart and soul it can cause anyone to tremble the soul can be anticipating some things could be shaken up here and it can feel scary to look at these things and then change looking deep at our life can feel daunting and scary so your response just might be regards to potential growth trying to happen or is there something about the therapist you dont feel confident about this too might be in play as a reason for your feelings maybe you lack confidence in that therapist  have you let your therapist know how you feel that would be good to explorei would like to encourage you to look at these ideas hope it helps let me knowkindlykeithkeithcounselingcom,Anxiety

ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,well its generally okay to feel anxious or nervous about going into therapy particularly in the beginning because the process of being open about what you are going through much less to someone who you dont know well can be anxietyproducing its also common to feel anxious when you are discussing something that is important difficult to discuss or you are making changes that are very difficult for youthe most important thing i can tell you though is to discuss with your therapist this idea that you feel nervous and shaky some anxiety can actually help to motivate or lead you toward change there are also level of anxiety that can be counterproductive so its a good thing to discuss personally i can tell you that i would want my clients to tell me about anxiety they feel 100 of the time that opens the dialog to discuss whether it is the level of anxiety that they want to sit with and learn about in discovering more about themselves and their experiences andor whether they would like to do something to lessen the feeling of anxietythanks for writing here if it caused anxiety for you to do so i hope that feeling is diminishing for you at least related to writing here,Anxiety
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,what you are experiencing is extremely normal opening up to someone you dont know from a can of paint can elicit some uncomfortable feelings and make you feel shaky with time and building trust with your therapist you will eventually start feeling less apprehensive before sessions consider bringing this up to your therapist as you both can process this experience together and figure out ways of coping with this anxiety before you come into the therapy room,Anxiety
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,hello first i am so sorry you are experiencing these feelings they can be intense i will do my best to offer some suggestions or thoughts that i hope will be helpful to you there could be a number of things occurring therapy is a delicate private decision and i would first like to commend you for the fact that you are not giving up that you are working to figure this out and make this work it sounds like you are engaged and motivated to receive support from a professional your continued dedication and motivation will take you far i would first start by asking if you have discussed this with your therapist if you feel comfortable enough telling your therapist what is going on maybe inform the therapist that that you feel nervous and shaky i am a firm believer in open communication between the client and therapist as this builds a healthy therapeutic relationship that yields positive outcomes if this can be obtained and well received this is your time for healing and therapy should be a safe supportive environment to not only process but to seek support and guidance from a professional who can help you move past the barriers if you feel you are comfortable and able to speak to your therapist that would be my first suggestion is to tell he or she how you are feeling if they know then they can help determine the potential cause and allow you to process and move forward if this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward if you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist i understand this is difficult if i may offer one more suggestion breathing exercises are very beneficial remind yourself what you are working to achieve close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips breathe in for approximately 510 seconds then let it out slowly be sure and do this when you are in private and feel safe environment when you begin i suggest putting your hand on your stomach over your belly button to feel yourself actually taking in those deep breaths i know it may sound kind of silly but they really work and are incredibly helpful we often forget to breathe especially when we are feeling anxious you are supported here and try taking yourself through the above thought process and breathing and practice the breathing several times a day i hope this shaky and uneasy feeling eases wishing you the very bestlaura cassity lmsw lmac,Anxiety
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,it can be uncomfortable talking to someone about your life in the great detail that is normally necessary for counseling to be beneficial since youre already going to counseling congratulations on taking that big first stressinducing step hopefully by now you are starting to feel a little more comfortable with your therapist it can be helpful to address this big elephant in the room and talk to your therapist about this i do my best to help people feel comfortable when they come to counseling but regardless of how hard we try sometimes it is just a little hard to get accustomed to the good news is the more you keep at it the more normal it will become,Anxiety
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,if you have only been to a couple of sessions it makes sense that you might still feel apprehensive at first therapy is hard work you may be talking about some things that you never talked to anyone about before opening up to stranger can be scary after you feel comfortable with your counselor and trust has built up and you feel understood in session you should feel more relaxed i would encourage you to talk to your counselor about feeling a little shaky sharing what the process is like for you is important in your work if you still feel unsure about sharing after several sessions it is important to take a look at that and try to understand where that may be coming from for example are you and the therapist not a good fit but again if you are just starting out in working together feeling a little bit nervous makes perfect sense and i encourage you to give it a bit more time and to talk to your therapist about how you are feeling,Anxiety
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,thank you for your question its completely normal and natural to feel nervous before a therapy session many people report having felt this way i cant say enough regarding the amount of courage it takes to reach out and attend a therapy session for many people it can take weeks months or even years of contemplating whether to see a therapist or not before actually contacting one and attending the first session it takes courage to want to work through any struggles you may be having or personal growth you aspire toward in your question you mentioned that youve gone several times and are still feeling nervous and shaky if you feel comfortable with your therapist and its a good fit for you i would suggest talking about this with your therapist you dont have to struggle each time you have your appointment together you and your therapist can work toward helping you have a different experience,Anxiety
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,its absolutely normal for some people its scary to even make the appointment for therapy it can be overwhelming to think about talking to a stranger about very personal information and thats exactly what we challenge you to do it can take quite a while to feel more comfortable with your counselor and the topics you discuss the more you show up despite your anxieties and talk about things that scare you the less likely it is that you will feel nervous and shaky beforehand depending on your expectations for sessions it could even be something you bring up to your counselor to process how that feels to you and maybe some reasons why that may be happening theres nothing wrong with feeling scared and i think its courageous of you to keep going sometimes feeling anxiety means we are doing something important to us it seems as if maybe therapy holds some pretty big meaning for you,Anxiety
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,sure why notits nervewracking to go to a man or woman youve never met before and who is a total stranger that you are paying to take an interest in your life youre likely feeling an internal truth about the sessions the man or woman with you and the man or woman sitting across from you id listen to those feelingswouldnt it not be best to go to those around you that do provide comfort and aid first wouldnt it be better to attend to those of faith around you who have love to offer first wouldnt it be better to go to your family and loved ones first might try that see if your nervousness evaporates,Anxiety

ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,it depends on your definition of normal i would say that the average client i see feels some level of nervous energy when they come into their sessions and especially at the beginning i think that with clients who i work with that have difficult times in relationships maybe being able to trust people is tougher for them given their life experiences the expectation would be that they have a harder time moving through those nerves and feeling more at peace in sessionsin my opinion a competent therapist could help you explore where these nerves are actually coming from talking about yourself relating to another something else i encourage all of my clients to bring up whatever emotions are coming up for them in the moment as its helpful to the client to recognize the present moment emotion and then being able to process learn from and move through to a more peaceful place if that is what is being sought,Anxiety
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,therapy can feel very weird to begin with  think about it how often do we go and tell a relative stranger our deepest darkest thoughts in the rest of our life so i think its reasonable to expect a certain level of nerves as you get used to your therapist and to the whole process of talking about yourself and vulnerable topics that said its definitely worth bringing to the attention of your therapist if you havent already to see if there is anything that they can do or that the two of you can explore together that might make the process feel less intimidating to you,Anxiety
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,it takes a lot of courage to go to therapy i have gone myself as a counselor and know what that feeling is like this is normal but hopefully you have become more comfortable with your therapist this might be something to bring up to your therapist and openly discuss scary to do but its ok this may even relieve some of your anxiety if it continues you may want to consider trying another therapist as this one may not be the best fit for you,Anxiety

when i get frustrated or upset it becomes extremely difficult to keep my voice down i also instantly cry and tend to have anxiety attacks what can i do to try and control it,im going to reframe this and you can decide if this is helpfulwhat im reading based on what you gave is that you are actually doing your best to manage intense feelings of internal dysregulation anger is something that is generally a protective emotion that quickly arises to keep us safe in some way whether or not the situation is truly a threat the part of our brain that perceives this is not controllable to us so we dont get to decide what emotions we respond withit does also sound like you are experiencing some significant anxiety maybe even underlying the anger without knowing the context its hard to say what would help on an individual level but working through those triggers and what is really influencing them deep down could be beneficial theres many different ways to do that in therapy if you so choose that as your pathif you do decide to see a therapist most will tell you that the goal is not necessarily to control your anxiety or anger sometimes theres a strong set of beliefs that when activated are catalysts to strong emotions that influence behavior trying to control an emotion on its own is usually unsuccessful for people because it leaves out all the other powerful elements at play emotions are information and the brain sends that information out because it believes we need it at that time therapists can help unravel that with you in whatever way you need whether thats with somatic work work at the level of belief or schemas or otherwisehitting it at these deeper layers can unpair andor decrease emotional responses it all takes work and time so dont get down on yourself if the process is complicated or slower than you expected or hoped forwhat we know though is that the brain is very capable of change even if its painful hope this gives you a helpful place to start from,Anxiety
my two adult sons live with me one has been having panic attacks and hasnt been able to work for over  months he doesnt want to get help im feeling so overwhelmed what can i do,my very first thought is this is so much to carry on your own a mothers instinct is to care for her children so i can imagine how hard it must be to see your son in pain and struggling i hear a ping of helplessness in there as well thats heavymy question is who is supporting you i know nothing about the context but i wonder if the role you hold often is that of caretaker it may not be that the endallbeall answer is to be cared for but the absence of care or even selfcare can seem like we are only existing for others sometimes having someone to rely on can help take off some of the edgethe pressureof all that is overwhelmingdespite that it may be that the situation continues to be exactly what it is providing a steady stream of stress for you which would be so difficult i dont think anyone can tell you what to do because no one here has to live with those consequences good or bad just a note that sometimes with men it is harder to reach out for help perhaps he feels comfortable enough for you to know hes struggling which means you have provided him a safe space to do just that but not comfortable enough to interact with a stranger about those same struggles men often avoid therapy because its seen as weak andor means you need help planting seeds here is sometimes all you can do as hard as that isas far as supporting goes theres much more you can do there if he is ready to receive that if you are seeing him in the midst of panic the best thing you can do is let him know you are there for him maybe that means being there physically or continuing to give him encouragement along the way eg you got this i know this is hard etc if you arent present for the attacks but hes telling you about them you can ask what you can provide for him in those moments or how you can help him afterward panic attacks can be taxing on the body so sometimes people need time to recover remember that you also need to recover here too its very painful to watch someone you love panic what might you need thereof course counseling can be a great place to work through that stress and overwhelm that time is all for you to be heard and understood you deserve to have someone there for you too,Anxiety
i have developed bad social anxiety within the last year and i just cant stand to be around people i recently got a new girlfriend and she is extremely close to her large family and wants me to be around them all of the time my last visit with them i was quiet and uncomfortable and she got mad,take small steps each day go around a few people take a walk and smile or wave at others strike up a conversation in the grocery aisle think of topics you enjoy and would like to share could talk about to break the ice maybe call some friends you once had and reconnect go at a pace that feels comfortable and in time you could release the reclusive energy to embrace a more social you i also wanted to share this short digital book with you the anxiety antidote,Anxiety
i have developed bad social anxiety within the last year and i just cant stand to be around people i recently got a new girlfriend and she is extremely close to her large family and wants me to be around them all of the time my last visit with them i was quiet and uncomfortable and she got mad,i think what you are describing is pretty common even people without social anxiety have a hard time talking to their partners familyit can feel overwhelmingone thing about social anxiety is that it creates avoidance behavior you may be avoiding conversation so you dont embarrass yourself or say something wrong or maybe even feel like people dont like you the truth is that those are just simply fears you may overanalyze how people react when you put yourself out there but we arent that great at reading what people are actually thinking based on body language unless we really know the person the challenge here is to avoid that avoidant behaviortalk to people you dont have to talk to everybody all at once just find a person you feel safeish with someone that seems pretty nice and open its ok to have anxiety about talking to people and its even ok if they know you are anxious social anxiety can cause us to think too much about how we respond which can make conversations seem choppy and unnatural pay attention to the way you respond to people you have less or no anxiety talking withwhat does this look like for you you can try to bring some of that to your conversations with her family or with anyone reallyanother thing to know is that its normal to change our conversational style to fit who we are talking with what that doesnt mean is being a completely different personits still totally ok to be you its just like applying a different filter based on the situation some of that will work itself out the more you practice and the more you put yourself out there its tough to know what the boundaries are of expression sometimes so be patient with yourself we all make many mistakes socially but thats necessary to learn about ourselves give yourself that chance,Anxiety

i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,fears are not that difficult to deal with first you need to train yourself to relax using some relaxation strategy once you are able to employ that in your daily life you then need to start facing your fear for instance ill use an example of a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge we would build a hierarchy of fears that is a list of fears ranging from least to most for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique then moving closer to the bridge then maybe standing on a bridge all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge or you can also engage in flooding which is for example if you were scared of an elevator go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore in the movie batman begins bruce wayne who has a great fear of bats goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them secondly look at your fears do they even need to be worked on some fears are healthy for example if i was a therapist in new york city and someone came to me and said im scared of snakes i would probably say that is ok because there are very little snakes left in manhattanhope that helps c,Anxiety
i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,it is commendable that you have acknowledged the fact that you have this fear and that you want to overcome it  micro steps doing a little bit each day to get closer to your goal of overcoming it working thru a list of ministeps that you can accomplish until you are fully immersed in your fear and overcoming it as you accomplish each step along the way implementing micro rewards so you can feel a sense of accomplishment and reward at each interval helps to want to keep going forward immersive therapy could help in this area,Anxiety
i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,everyone has fears whatever your fear is it can be helpful to breakdown the thing that creates anxiety or fear into small steps for instance lets say you are afraid of speaking in public if your goal would be to one day speak to a room of people you would start by creating a list of lesser fears that would eventually lead to the main fear of speaking in public you could start your list with things that might be less anxietyproducing such as asking for help at a store or speaking up in class or at work if something is bothering you as you buildup to what you fear the most you will have taken baby steps while assessing whether or not what you feared most was as bad as you thought it would be if it wasnt that will help boost your confidence and help move you to the next step this is called an exposure hierarchy and it is something you can do on your own or with the help of a counselor,Anxiety
i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,i think its super brave to want to face your fears so you are already moving in a great directionno matter if your fear is something rational eg fear of spiders or something that seems irrational eg fear of clocks there is always a reason your brain has considered the thing you fear to be a threat having a fear of spiders makes sense because in evolutionary terms we need to fear things that could harm us on the other hand fearing clocks may seem irrational without context however if you experienced something traumatic while listening to the ticking of a clock throughout the event your brain may equate clocks with danger the reason for this is clear in much of the neuroscience research we have available in our brains we have amygdalae which are basically just the watch dogs of the brain they are incredibly good at scanning our environment for any threats whether or not we perceive those threats as rational because this part of the brain does not operate via logicand it shouldnt if we sense danger because theres a bear in our presence we dont need logic to survivewe need to just respond in ways that keep us safe if something really terrifying happens to us our brains burn that all that information into the amygdalae including any peripheral information this is why we can fear things that really arent innately scary like clocksmoving through something you fear isnt easy it can be very emotionally difficult and feel pretty awful the good news is working with fears is one of the most researched areas of psychology and there are many evidencebased techniques that can helpone of the best techniques for changing the brains response is exposure this technique involves exposing yourself little by little to the very thing you fear the reason this is so effective is because the amygdalae can only learn via experience if you avoid what you fear that teaches your brain that that object or situation is dangerous and over time that only strengthens the fear conversely if you expose yourself to something you fear and sit through a full fear response eventually your anxiety returns to your baseline which sends the message that the object or situation is not dangerousto begin with exposure first its important to have some mindfulness techniques built up this can be deep breathing muscle tensionrelaxation etc its important to know that this is in place for relaxation not to distract from the exposure process because you really want to feel that anxiety to wake up the amygdalaeyour brain cant learn a new response if you distract from the anxiety theres countless videos and recordings on youtube as well as apps like calm or headspace that can teach some of those techniquesnext you can create a fear hierarchy start with things connected to your fear that serve as triggers but dont completely overwhelm you for example if you have a fear of spiders you may start with pictures of spiders then videos then fake plastic spiders seeing a spider in person and finally touching a spider nonpoisonous this is a very simple listsome people have many many triggers associated with their fears and thats normal when you have your list you can scale each trigger by how much anxiety it gives you so on a scale from 1100 if seeing pictures of spiders puts you at a 60 then your goal for that part of the hierarchy is to cut it in half to 30 meaning you cut your anxiety in half sometimes this can take multiple exposures with the same trigger though exposure is very powerful and tends to be a much quicker process than most people think i know this is a lot of information to take in and i hope it all makes sense its not all you can do but its so effective and of course it is best when you are getting assistance from a counselor if you feel that you need that kind of support a counselor would be able to actually do some insession mindfulness and exposure techniques with you depending on the fear to help prepare you for doing it on your own,Anxiety
i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,your fear may have deeper roots within your sense of who you are than you realize fears are sometimes irrational so that logic doesnt get rid of themthink about whether you felt secure and confident as a child also did any major bad events happen to you with other people or situations when you were growing upoften these overwhelming situations of childhood stay with us as fears of situations in our adult lives if the root of the problem w the fear is from long ago then probably a therapist who can ask you questions which help you remember upsetting childhood circumstances may help you to dissolve the current fearanother possibility is cbt cognitive behavior therapy which teaches people short term mantras to do something which is safe say being a passenger in a commercial airplane which feels frightening to a personcbt is short term and results are limited to specific fears it is a much quicker approach than selfunderstanding,Anxiety
i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,fear is a part of life in fact our five main emotions are joy fear sadness shame and anger we tend to spend a lot of time and energy running away from or trying to get rid of most of those emotions and the more we do that the more we set ourselves up for failure and disappointment as a result of viewing our human emotions as bad or wrong we often get caught up in a trap of thinking we have to overcome them or get rid of them before we can do what matters to us in reality you can do what is important to you while having your fears my question for you is what would you do if this fear was completely gone what behaviors would you have if you were the ideal you what skills knowledge or personal qualities would you develop what kind of relationships would you havei imagine your fear has kept you from achieving those goals because your mind tells you you cant do it until the fear is gone i challenge you to do the following exercisewhat is a goal you would like to achieve example i would like to change careerswhat actions are necessary to complete this goal example see a career counselor to determine my ideal career go back to schoolget a certification network with others in my desired industrywhat thoughts feelings or urges might get in my way example thoughts of what if i fail im not smart enough i cant do it im too busy to put energy into this feelings of fear shame excitement urges to distract myself through drinking or watch tv instead of taking actionit would be helpful to remind myself that example it is natural to have these thoughts feelings and urges but i can take action anyway i deserve to have a fulfilling lifethe smallest and easiest step i can take now example research career counselors in my area and write down their phone numbersthe time day and date that i will take that first step is example tonight at 7pm at least think through these answers but it is most beneficial to write them down i hope this helps,Anxiety
i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,this answer could be very different depending on the fear the degree of it and what it connects toi wonder the followingon a scale of 1 to 10 how upset anxious or scared to you get when you think about overcoming this if its more than a 510 i would definitely recommend talking with a therapist in your areaa lot of fears that we have come from something that at one time was selfprotective and important do you know where your fear started if you think it is still protecting you or helping you in some way talk with someone like a therapist about itif it is something that you know is irrational for example fear of being hurt by static cling from winter clothing is there some part of that that you are not afraid ofi really encourage you to consider whether your fear has a lot of emotions connected to it or if it ties from something in your past that was very emotional for you at the time if it does consider working with a therapist to establish emotional safety before taking away the fear or anxiety that may actually be helpful to youalso the fact that you notice that you are afraid of something and you dont want to be afraid of it anymore is a big step in the forward direction,Anxiety
i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,biologically fear is designed to protect us from harm fear is not always a bad thing and in fact can be quite healthy and appropriate depending on the situation a phobia however is different you used the term fear rather than phobia a phobia is an irrational fear  meaning it is not rational for you to fear that thing if your situation is a phobia exposure therapy can help this consists of gradually exposing yourself a little at a time to the thing you are afraid of some people with phobias find that the irrational fear interferes with their life and they do need to overcome it someone who is afraid to drive over bridges may go to great lengths to avoid routes that have bridges people who are afraid of elevators may always use the stairs instead which may not always be feasible if overcoming a phobia will improve the quality of your life then by all means seek professional help to overcome iteveryone has fears or things that make them nervous public speaking asking a person out fear of failure examine what your fear is and try to determine the reason for the fear when you can get to the root cause of the fear you can deal with that issue a lot of times it is a selfesteem issue you may be able to peel back the layers of the fear and find out whats causing it and deal with the real issue some fears are caused by trauma someone with ptsd is going to have an exaggerated fear response and will find themselves being kicked into fight or flight mode over things that someone without the trauma experience wouldnt notice or react to in cases like this exposure therapy would be the wrong approach and could actually make things worse if there is a possibility that a past trauma is the cause of your fear i strongly urge you to seek a therapist  not just any therapist but one who is trained to work with trauma and abuse victims,Anxiety

my son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and i stopped working so that i could take care of him i also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people how can i feel more comfortable around other people,theres a lot of layers there to your situation and im focusing on two layers that may be contributing to your feelings of discomfort around others one layer is the daunting news that your son has autism many parents can feel overwhelmed and distraught with this diagnosis the vast array of treatments available is daunting in and of itself at times to wrap ones head around taking time to reflect or seek out therapy regarding how this diagnosis has impacted you may be helpful some parents feel their individual identity gets lost in the diagnosis because they have dropped everything to help their child and others may experience guilt if either of these or other feelings come to the forefront for you it may be worth working through them with a therapist a support group list is available through wwwautismspeaksorg and may help connect you with others raising children with autisma second layer is the abusive relationship you were involved in the trauma you experienced in this relationship may have a very meaningful impact on your ability to trust and to be intimate with others engaging with a therapist can help facilitate the healing process as well as paving the way for more comfortable and trusting relationships,Anxiety

my son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and i stopped working so that i could take care of him i also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people how can i feel more comfortable around other people,i have to start off by saying that i admire you so much for your devotion to your son and the fact that you stopped working to focus on and care for him that cannot have been easy not to mention being in an abusive relationship where you are made to fear for your physical but also your emotional safety you may or may not believe this but it sounds like youre a really strong person and it also sounds like you want to feel better about yourself and be social with others however you dont know how to do that right now because like any normal person who has been harmed by someone and who has felt unsafe by someone you may not trust so easily you are out of practice with being around others and having healthy relationships and because of what you have been through you get anxiety from being social the fact that you want to change that though is a huge positive was there ever a time when you didnt feel nervous around others was there ever a time when you did feel comfortable around people what goes through your mind when the idea of socializing comes up these are some questions to explore in order to determine how you could feel more comfortable around people in order to really answer your question i feel i need more information from you in the meantime though the first step is to recognize that you are not abnormal in your feelings quite the opposite and to not put pressure on yourself when you feel nervous around others my suggestion is to seek therapy so that someone can make more specific recommendations by asking you some more questions as more information is needed to really assist best of luck,Anxiety
my son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and i stopped working so that i could take care of him i also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people how can i feel more comfortable around other people,its understandable that you would feel this way considering what you have been and are going through with your son and the past abusive relationship it sounds like you got into a pattern of being home with your son and not around others for a while so understandably you have gotten used to this lifestyle that makes it harder but not impossible to get back out there and be around other people and begin to feel more comfortable around others again you can do this by taking baby steps take it slow try reaching out to one person who you know and like and maybe meet them for coffee try putting yourself in a setting that feels non threatening to outside your home and is something you can also enjoy even with your son depending on his needs it will take time as you probably want to process your feelings about what you went through but you can get there good luck,Anxiety
my son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and i stopped working so that i could take care of him i also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people how can i feel more comfortable around other people,it might be helpful to have a good understanding of the why in terms of feeling nervous around people or the difficulty in developing more comfort if your discomfort is somehow related to your sons diagnosis or your lack of employment or an abusive relationship you were in and maybe embarrassed about that is important to understand and get clarity around when we can understand on a deep level what is happening for us ie where does fear come into this and whats it about we can give ourselves empathy everyone struggles in some aspect so to not necessarily think of yourself as pathological is a first step sometimes being around people can trigger an anxiety related to being good enough that goes back a ways in our history if any of the above is true it would need acknowledgement and care from you as opposed to shaming that experience in the hopes it would just go away because this experience is very real for you,Anxiety

i have been with my boyfriend for more than a year he recently got a new job and travels a lot im not used to him being gone all the time i feel as though he has forgotten about me because he does not talk with me as much and doesnt keep me up to date on everything that he does throughout the day which he used to i feel lost sad and unwanted this is really a tough new challenge i just want to break up with him but i love him so much i dont know why he is acting this way lately i believe i have separation anxiety is there anything that i can do to help me cope with this while he is out of town,relationships at any amount of distance can be so hard it makes sense that you are encountering more anxiety than usual given that major change in your relationship and youre right that being separated from our partners can heighten our insecurities and worries about not only our relationship security but about our partners interest have you talked with your boyfriend about this struggle youre feeling it can be hard to have this kind of conversation without triggering a sense of blame and subsequent defensiveness in our partners but it really is possible if you have any concerns about being able to do this then a session or two with a local counselor or therapist might be really helpful  and it really can be just about finding the way to share what youre feelingas far as coping with anxiety there are a lot of options but i highly recommend an app called selfhelp for anxiety management theres so much good information in this app to help you learn to pay attention to what kinds of thoughts are helpful or unhelpful and there are also lots of activities for calming down and decreasing the intensity of that anxiety the best part is its free,Anxiety

i feel insecure in my life i dont think my wife truly wants our relationship even though she says she does i have turned to drinking to help relieve my repressed stress about this and other issues i have had a drinking problem for a few years i feel the reason i drink is not just because i like to but because i have lately been on edge ive been very oddly emotional when watching movies that i have been watching for years im paranoid about driving on main roads im very jumpy at the slightest noises,given the description you have posted here it may be time to find someone to work with first and foremost look into working with someone who specializes in working with individuals with challenges surrounding drinking this would need to be assessed first since if it has been ongoing it may be making the situation worse and given the time it has been utilized as a coping mechanism there is reason to believe that the structure of your brain may have been effected as has been demonstrated by current neurological research there are however ways to address this as for coping mechanisms the person you work with should also look at offering you alternatives such as the skills found within the dialectic behavior therapy model dbt which has several useful tools to help address the underlying anxiety and difficulty managing emotional regulation mindfulness another component of dbt should also prove to be useful in both becoming aware of your state of mind and emotional state to allow you to make different choices which has been supported by a growing body of evidence there are also other tools designed to help repair damaged relationships well worth looking intoseeking help is never easy and it is only human to be hesitant given some of the cultural views of working with therapist this is a difficult place to be in and one that is not easy to move out of but sitting on it is not going to help it go away think of it this way if you broke your arm would you just wrap it up and hope for the best or seek out a professional to help you set the break and teach you how to mend the wound the same applies here think of it as first aid for the mind,Anxiety

i have anxieties about everyday stressors ie finances work relationships kids and maintaining a household,something to remember about anxiety is that its a useful and necessary response to stressors and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming anxiety is our brains way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple the first id recommend is a calm breathing technique  breathe in for 45 seconds and then out for 78 seconds try to repeat this for 35 minutes another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe  without judging  the sensations to yourself try to be very specific such as my palms are feeling very sweaty and i can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad  just experiencing them as intentionally as possible combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful if you feel that these techniques dont help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to then id highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional this professional can help you determine if therapycounseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms,Anxiety

i have anxieties about everyday stressors ie finances work relationships kids and maintaining a household,since it is clear that people react differently to the same stressors we know that the stressors are not causing the anxiety our thoughts about the stressors are often cognitive distortions are the problem some common cognitive distortions include catastrophizing predicting the worst future telling black and white thinking if its not perfect its terrible mindreading i just know he is angry at me and cantstanditis i cant stand this situation there are more but the list is long and if some of these are resonating with you i would advise looking up cbt cognitive behavioral therapy tips worksheets booklets etc on line or contact a local cbt therapist another helpful piece of info on anxiety is that it is prone to something called symptom stress  being anxious about anxiety if we could hear this symptom stress it might sound like oh no im getting nervous about this im getting uptight i look nervous what if i have a panic attack followed by more cognitive distortions such as i cant stand being anxious and this is horrible the antidote to this is acceptance kind of like not stopping the waves but learning to surf instead jon kabatzinn if you happen to feel anxious say to yourself  this is just a reaction im having that is unpleasant but not horrible i can tolerate and survive some anxiety i can breathe deeply and ill be ok because panic attacks never killed anyone i can stand this and it is temporary you get the ideawe can increase our awareness of anxietyprovoking selftalk and counteract it with calming and reassuring selftalk we have the ability to think about our thinking decide which thoughts are healthy and which are unhealthy and choose which to focus on we brainwash ourselves with our thinking and according to selfperception theory  we learn what we believe when we hear ourselves speak so we may as well be a calming reassuring presence in our own minds,Anxiety
i dont understand why this is happening why do i feel this way,social anxiety has skyrocketed since covid plus could be trauma or ptsd maybe you are a known person and feel safer not going so much out in public i understand as a known person in my field depending on where i am it can be a bit much or maybe the things you found joy in before are not as much of an interest it could be your age or menapause hormones and injury so many things could be in play depending on the client and their lifestyle always best to get a check up see if there is under lining medical issues and then go from there,Anxiety
i dont understand why this is happening why do i feel this way,there could be a few reasons thats happening if you are afraid of leaving your home and going other places that may be an anxiety response not all people who feel this way have all the criteria for agoraphobia but that doesnt mean its not hard and doesnt interfere with your life this may be triggered by a fear of being around people or people seeing you it may also feel like leaving the safety of your home is too overbearing without a clear indication as to why when it is the latter its typically brought on by an anxiety disorder such as panic disorderif you have lost interest in going outside that may be a very different clinical picture did you used to enjoy getting outside but now feel like it is no longer enjoyable have you lost interest in other things that you used to find joy in when depression is the culprit it can feel like you dont get excited about things you used to like which is also accompanied at times by feelings of worthlessness hopelessness sleep and eating changes and frequent sadness its not uncommon for anxiety and depression symptoms to coexist so you may be experiencing a little or maybe a lot of both if you feel like you need to speak to somebody about what you are going through counselors can usually help and with the option of telehealth online counseling you dont have to leave your home to do soif you dont have access to a counselor your primary doctor can also help you understand your symptoms better and maybe even recommend some other options for you,Anxiety
i dont understand why this is happening why do i feel this way,one reason may have to do with physical anxiety symptoms this is common for people who experience panic attacks or physical anxiety symptoms often it begins with just avoiding certain places or activities where the symptoms happen over time its common for it to spread to more and more places and situations until many people get in the habit of not leaving their home at all in an effort to avoid the symptoms,Anxiety
i dont understand why this is happening why do i feel this way,the short answer i could give is that we dont know why its happening the longer answer could come from deeper exploration as to your fears or anxieties that you experience maybe just thinking of going outside but any sort of exploration about this almost has to begin with an agreement within you and all of your feelings thats its not something to be ashamed of if we are ashamed of any of our behaviors then we lose the ability to sit with them and see where they are coming from this could be something that can be worked through in therapy and specifically with a therapist who specializes in anxiety and more specifically agoraphobia,Anxiety
i dont understand why this is happening why do i feel this way,the first step to answer your question is to reflect on what is going on in your life overall if youre in the midst of severe stress whether within your relationship or effort to establish a relationship upheaval in family dynamics some type of significant loss like a job or someone with whom you feel closely attached then you may simply be creating the solitude which is necessary to better understand and absorb the meaning of these changesi assume you mean you are by yourself when you are indoorswhat you write sounds like youre not happy with this recent urge rather than that you and someone or others are having great and fun times togetherone way to encourage yourself to go back outdoors is to connect w a friend or search for an interest within you to developthis way with either of these youd feel a little bit of motivation to join and get more involved with either of these,Anxiety

i had a head injury a few years ago and my mind races all the time i have trouble sleeping and have a lot of anxiety every medicine i have been on my body rejects i get sick to my stomach and get blisters in my mouth how can i calm my self down im a wreck,you didnt say what or how many medications youve tried certain anxiety medications can make you feel nauseous but i havent heard of any that cause mouth blisters so there may be some other underlying medical issue there i would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if youve suffered a severe head injury there are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effectsbut beyond that have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation meditation can be very effective but it takes practice and you dont have to sit crosslegged for hours chanting ohm to meditate its about focusing on your breath rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head and when they do take your mind off your breath simply refocus and refocus and refocus like i said it takes practice so dont give up you can find many sites offering different ways to meditate so look around and see what works best for you like medication you just have to find the one that works best and that might take some experimentationi hope this helps and best of luck to you,Anxiety
ive known my best friend for eight years and ive slowly begun to form a crush on him i sort of thought he liked me back until he told me about his actual crush i have really bad anxiety over this,that must feel heartbreaking to you where do you think that anxiety comes from i would try some selfreflecting to see what comes up there maybe you are worried about losing your best friend or something completely different its understandable that you would have a lot of feelings in this situation especially since this person is very close to you the dealing with it part is probably going to be pretty tough you are processing through circumstances that you probably cant talk to him your best friend about do you have anyone else you can talk through it with maybe another good friend or someone that knows the situation when were most in need sometimes we become more aware of who around us can be of help a counselor can help here too if thats an option you are considering or have access toif he does start leaning on you to talk about his crush there may be some boundaries that you could consider putting up that may mean distancing from him a bit or telling him how you feel that part is all up to what you feel most right doing and what works best for your friendship try to remember that you are not less than just because he may not reciprocate the same romantic feelings you do we are all worthy of that kind of love,Anxiety
im socially awkward ive always want to be popular ive had the opportunity to be popular but every time i get it im too scared all i have to do is talk the popular people theyre really nice to me but im too scared of change i really want to work up the courage to lose my fear,talking to people can be pretty scary when we talk to people sometimes we overanalyze what we say or how we react in fear that we will seem weird or they wont like us which makes us appear awkward so that overthinking piece can ironically work against uswhen you talk to them really spend time to listen to what they are saying your default may be to think about how you will respond or whats cool to say but people like it best usually when you are genuine and yourself if you focus on what you are paying attention to them then you will naturally have a response if you can overthink about yourself you can definitely have some thoughts pop up when talking to other peoplealso keep in mind that if the conversations turn out to be less than youd hoped for thats ok im assuming you are in high school but in any situation with peers if they dont like you then they arent worth all your worry and effort give change a chanceyouve endured change in your life before this so let it happen again you are in control hereyou get to choose who you talk to and dont talk to that can be powerful,Anxiety

i havent been feeling like myself lately ive been upset for no reason and feeling anxious im feeling burnt out what can help me feel better,i would first say that those are difficult thoughts and feelings that sound exhausting i cant image how this must feel but i can assure you that you are not alone these are common experiences in our society where we are made to feel as though we must go go go especially in the current world situation even simple things can feel overwhelming i believe that starting with baby steps such as taking even 1020 minutes for yourself daily to be in the quiet and reflect can be helpful recognizing that even small selfcare steps such as drinking more water eating healthier foods or taking a hot bath can be helpful to relieve stress,Anxiety
i havent been feeling like myself lately ive been upset for no reason and feeling anxious im feeling burnt out what can help me feel better,its ok that you are going through that even though it is probably very miserable feeling burnt out is usually a sign that something is out of balance in our lives and we need to make some adjustmentshow are boundaries set up in your life if these are lacking in your work life social life or personal life that could be draining this can be all too true for people that feel like putting up boundaries is selfish or that others will reject you if you do however realistic boundaries are super healthy for both yourself and others for example i have a boundary on how many people i see in a week and when i discuss workrelated issuesthis helps me take care of myself in ways that make me a better counselor and lets other people know exactly what i expect so theres no guessinganother question to consider is what are you doing to recharge from stressors we tend to get so caught up in responsibilities that we miss opportunities to slow down we try to put a blind eye to how we are feeling and just push through but our bodies will tell us when its too much whether thats through physical pain emotional pain or both consider the metaphor of a car if you are low on gas your gas light comes on you can keep driving but eventually youre going to need to stop and fill up no matter how badly you want to make it to the next exit anxiety and other feelings popping up may be a sign you are just too overwhelmed and need to rechargehow you attempt that may look different from others what brings you joy is there a person or people that recharge you or do you recharge better doing something alone if you feel its a struggle to find answers to these questions try to remember things that have peaked your interests and brought you joy in the past it could be something as simple as taking a walk creating something baking etc it can be a process so no matter how quickly you want to move through this just be patient with yourself,Anxiety
i havent been feeling like myself lately ive been upset for no reason and feeling anxious im feeling burnt out what can help me feel better,does it help to put a name to the experience you are having where you first said ive been upset for no reason and feeling anxious you then say that you are feeling burnt out which gives a little more context to what may have once felt like no reason perhaps you are feeling burnt out that is a big deal and please try not to take it lightly when we get burnt out i have found that its from one of two things either we are not doing what we want or we are doing too much either of something we want or something we dont doesnt really matter once we get into doing too muchif either of those rings true for your experience try as much as possible to sit with the experience and get a better sense of where the burn out is coming from i wrote about burnout for a newsletter and it is on my website i dont want to do shameless promotion but i thought it could also add to helping you httpsdavidkleintherapycommyexperienceswithburnouti hope that you can also see that its not an abnormal experience,Anxiety
i havent been feeling like myself lately ive been upset for no reason and feeling anxious im feeling burnt out what can help me feel better,theres no such possibility that youre upset for no reasonthe reason is not obvious not that you are feeling upset in response to nothing at allwhat can help you feel better is to be kind and gentle with yourself because this sort of approach will more likely relax your mood and mindset enough for the tension and anxiety you feel to dissipate somewhattry to understand whether certain situations or interactions remind you or feel similar to ones which distressed you beforethis may be the reason for your anxietyit is good news that you know the difference between your usual sense of yourself and that youve been away from this feelinggive yourself a little credit for understanding yourself giving credit adds confidence and confidence will help you find the reasons and new ways to handle your anxiety,Anxiety
i start thinking deeply about everything i may do or say and about anything that may happen i really want to avoid it since it really bothers me,as you know probably very well those types of thinking patterns are energy suckers im assuming you are often tired and dont sleep as well as you could especially as our thoughts tend to creep up on us when we are trying to fall asleepone thing to know is that those thought patterns are a protective mechanism ruminating on what could happen and how we will respond is how we feel prepared for whats to come in a logical sense theres so much uncertainty in life that trying to plan all that out is nearly impossible although not a bad idea to have a game plan or rehearse how you are going to respond to conflict endlessly revisiting those things tend to take away from why we want to be prepared in the first placeto protect our wellbeing in any aspect the trick is how to calm the brain which is so much easier said than done to start take the time to write your thoughts down you can do that via journaling or by splitting a piece of paper into two categories one side is helpful planning and other side unhelpful planning the brain is a spectacular organ but sometimes we really need to see things externally to be able to process them effectively excessive worry is really a result of pretty significant fearswhether those fears come from not feeling like you can handle situations that other people cant handle things that you will lose something important to you or that you will fail writing about those fears could help you understand where those thoughts are coming from or you could even talk those out with a friend or counselor sometimes someone elses feedback about our situations can change how we see things since we tend to get perpetually stuck in the same perspectivesmy last suggestion is to work on trying to stay in the present via mindfulness at least 5 minutes a day its probably going to feel foreign and weird maybe even scary since you live more in the future vs the present moment its common for the brain to respond by trying to push back into those thinking patterns but mindfulness actually increases your ability to problemsolve and see things more clearly constant anxiety clouds us mindfulness clears that out and im sure you really could use a brain break,Anxiety
i have a panic attack at least once a week and suffer from severe anxiety,im sorry youre going through that panic attacks are terrifyingone thing to start with is knowing that panic attacks are not going to hurt you and your anxiety will come down with time fighting that process can sometimes heighten symptoms because your brain wants the message of panic to be heard some of the best ways to counter that message is through focusing on the present moment through sensations or breathing taking deep breaths allows your body and brain to slow down sending the message that theres no present danger focusing on the present can also send the same message as anxiety typically throws us into the what ifs of the future if you search google or pinterest there are tons of methods you can use for thissome people prefer to focus on colors shapes smells textures etc while other prefer to pay attention to internal sensations there are also apps that can help with these techniques such as calm and headspace they work best when you arent in a panic attack or when you feel one coming on if you are already at the peak of an attack they can still help it just may take a bit longer some clients i have like to track their anxiety with a scale system lets say you scale your anxiety at an 8 out of 10 do some breathing exercises for 5 minutes then scale it again its likely the anxiety decreased at least to a 7 or 75 doing this can give you some physical proof that you have some control over your body you can also scale it without the breathing to see how it just fluctuates on its own anxiety will always go down and you can see that happening via numbers this method will let you see the light at the end of the tunnelthere are other ways that might work for you via a quick google search or through therapy keep trying new things until you find what works best for you,Anxiety
i was in a car accident and totaled my car i gave up my job of nine years to pursue school fulltime to better myself i failed a class and my boyfriend that i live with thinks im stupid and wants to break up with me i have nowhere to go and i feel like im losing everything,doesnt sound like your boyfriend is a source of support and im really sorry to hear that and my assumption is that the car accident was traumatic for you and still impacts you in some waysby just reading what you wrote im not sure what that impact has been on you but i get the impression that maybe you are now carless and have no reliable method of transportation to get to school or other places you need to go maybe you are also scared to be in a vehicle my first thought after reading this is that i wouldnt be thrilled about getting into a car if mine was totaled in an accident it may even incite terror none of that is your faultits an expected response to a horrible situationmy second thought was that you are obviously very committed and reliable if you had a job of nine years not to mention brave for stepping out of the comfort of a job to pursue school fulltime thats a giant transition that you should get so much credit for from yourself and from the people closest to you failing doesnt mean you made the wrong decision ive failed classes as well when i was just starting out in college it truly doesnt mean anything about youit just means that things got in the way and you can either try again or learn something about yourself or both and what you want out of an academic career the feelings around failing may feel raw at the moment but readdress them in a couple weeks or a month and notice how your perspective may change as well as the steps you may take despite the situation be careful of how much your boyfriend is contributing to how you feel about yourself too im guessing you already felt pretty terrible then his words or actions rubbed it in who do you have in your life that is compassionate toward you if you arent sure seeking out a counselor can be really great with all the emotions of a big transition like you are going through in the meantime focus on the things you have total control overyour breath little choices that you make throughout the day etc mindfulness and meditation can be a way for you to get some peace and slow down from the chaos of your life and thoughts,Anxiety
i was in a car accident and totaled my car i gave up my job of nine years to pursue school fulltime to better myself i failed a class and my boyfriend that i live with thinks im stupid and wants to break up with me i have nowhere to go and i feel like im losing everything,when we feel overwhelmed by life situations it is important to understand where the feeling is coming from once we understand the source it is important to normalize the situations that got us there and find balance in our livesfirst car accidents are common and since they are accidents they are not a reflection of us when we have an accident we feel anxious worried and may have some trauma after the accidents if you have been experiencing anxiety since the car accident talk to your doctor or therapist about it second a lot of people fail classes tasks deadlines etc but they dont give up on their goal we have to remember that failing is part of the learning process and having the courage to try again is what gives us determination and character remind yourself what motivated you to leave your job and the courage and determination that took to do so then channel that energy back into school third when we have problems in our relationships is helpful to look for ways to improve communication discuss our concerns and how we want to resolve them but it may be that the relationship needs to end if there isnt enough interest in one of the parts or if theres verbal or emotional abuse consider talking to your boyfriend and set some boundaries regarding appropriate communicationat all times focus on being kind to yourself and improving your selfesteem increase selfcare activities do more things that you enjoy meditate in what gives you peace and make an effort to have more of that in your life at the end you are the one in control of your life and you determine who you becomequ puedo hacer cuando siento que mi vida est fuera de controlestuve en un accidente de auto y fue prdida total deje mi trabajo de 9 aos para completar un grado a tiempo completo falle una clase y mi novio piensa que soy estpida el quiere dejarme no tengo a donde ir y siento que lo estoy perdiendo todocuando nos sentimos agobiados es importante reconocer donde estamos parados y entender de donde vienen esas emociones ya que entendemos la fuente de agobio es importante normalizar las situaciones que lo causaron y volver a encontrar el balance en nuestra vidaprimero los accidentes de auto son comunes y por ser accidentes no son un reflejo de nosotros o nuestras destrezas cuando experimentamos accidentes no s sentimos ansiosos preocupados y puede que experimentemos algn trauma si sientes ansiedad extrema preocupacin habla con tu doctor o terapista al respecto segundo muchas personas fallan clases tareas fechas de entrega pero no se rinden tenemos que recordar que fallar es parte del proceso de aprendizaje y tener el valor de intentarlo de nuevo es lo que nos da determinacin y carcter recuerda que te impuls a dejar tu trabajo y canaliza esa energa en la escuela tercero cuando tenemos problemas en las relaciones es importante comunicar nuestras preocupaciones y diferencias pero puede ser que la relacin termine si no hay inters mutuo o si hay algn tipo de abuso considera hablar con tu novio y establecer lmites respecto a la comunicacin apropiadaen todo momento enfcate en cuidarte a ti misma y mejorar tu autoestima aumenta las actividades que te ayudan a sentirte bien medita sobre lo que te paz y pasa ms tiempo practicando esas actividades,Anxiety
i have been thinking a lot about certain situations and having my worries about what others may think or say,i think its a great idea that you are asking this question now while its early on the first thing i wonder is what age you are at different transitions and stages in life its really common for anxieties to come out of the woodwork first time this takes place at a greater level is during adolescence because a teens job is to figure out who they are within the context of other people spikes in anxiety also can also occur after high school when you are leaving the nest and heading to college or the late twenties when it feels like you are expected to have your life figured out and compare to where others are in their lives that same scenario can show up in midlife as well for different reasons depending on the person aside from age certain circumstances can influence a jump in anxiety such as a job change switching schools moving opening a business college finals etc take some time to explore where the anxiety might be coming from and just see what comes up it may be something you have some control over or something that you can ask for help from someone else forespecially if its social anxiety the more you practice social skills the more confidence youll have in the longruna metaphor i use with some people is gas for a car anxiety is a necessary motivator for action though you get to decide where to go with that anxiety an overfilled tank doesnt get you any further than a normallyfilled tank and more gas doesnt mean the gas is in charge of where you go applying that to what i know about your situationhow much of that worrying is getting you somewhere how much is just extra gas and are the worries changing what you really want to do sometimes knowing the makeup of our anxiety gives us more power over how we deal with it and i think you could for sure get there with some help,Anxiety
i have a fear of talking with people i dont like to go out to social events im always worrying about someone judging me,thanks for reaching out and asking this question social stuff is hard even for people that dont have diagnosed social anxiety some research outlines that our fear of public speaking is greater than our fear of death thats hefty shame is often the culprit for social anxiety because we think other people will see the flaws in ourselves that we believe are there ive had experiences where i thought the person thought something awful of me just to find out it was exactly the opposite thats how powerful our minds can bewhat are other things that people may think of you maybe you are very kind and easy to talk to maybe you think differently than other people and some people enjoy hearing your perspectives its even a possibility that they are worrying about the same things as you even if they seem very confident confidence can be easy to fake if its how you cope with fearto work through some of that its much better to force yourself out there and have conversations avoiding people sends the message to your brain that not only are those situations dangerous socially but that you cant handle them the more you avoid the harder it gets and the more anxiety is created by just the thought of being around people take it moment by moment too thinking about all the conversations you are confronted with in a day is overwhelming just focus on getting through each conversation and give yourself credit for doing thateven if you felt awkward embarrassed etc social skills can be taught at any stage of life and theres always room for mistakes no one in society communicates perfectly and you dont need to put that pressure on yourselfthe last thing id say is keep at least 13 people in your life that feel really good to talk tolike its not a task talking to acquaintances and random people is not to fulfill a need for close connection unless you end up finding a great friend but more to feel like you are definitely able to handle conversations without the threat of crippling anxiety you may even get to a place where you enjoy it sometimes reach out to people in your life if you need extra support,Anxiety
i have a bad habit of thinking and worrying about what others may think of me i really want to stop it and enjoy things,we all experience that to a different level depending on who you ask its actually born out of a good qualityprosocialness when we care what others think of us we are also attuned to how we are treating them and whats socially right vs wrong it definitely does feel like its more about ourselves howevermeaning it feels like we worry about what others think because we dont want to be socially outcast or rejected thats also again to a certain level a healthy quality it means you want connection connection is crucial to mental health and according to some available research physical health no matter how mentally healthy or socially confident you are if you care about connection youre going to care about what people think of you to an extent so the work here is to figure out what worry is warranted vs what is just causing you suffering a good way to tell the difference here is to write it out in list form write out all the sociallyanxious thoughts you have and scale them from needed or helpful to unnecessary or unhelpful some may fall in the gray area here for example if you worry that others think you are inconsiderate so you often say sorryweed out whats actually inconsiderate vs what you feel is maybe inconsiderate because you feel like a burden to others getting in someones personal space would warrant some worry and an apology asking for help when you need it is something you dont have to apologize for something else to consider here is theres probably some underlying shame shame is a cluster of really tough feelings and if it had a voice itd say things like youre not good enough you arent likeable you are annoying and no one wants to be around you etc those feelings typically create the worry you experience about others shame survives and is strengthened by the attention you give to it the more you compete with it the less powerful it becomes sometimes that comes in the form of noticing the wonderful qualities in yourself sometimes it takes practice putting yourself out there when its really scary no matter what shames nemesis is connectionto yourself and to others thats how you prove its wrong try not to take shame at face valueif you are struggling with using these techniques or just dont know if they are right for you a counselor can help you out and give you a more individualized approach sometimes its just figuring out that specific formula that works for you that makes all the difference and of course counseling is built on a strong connectioni wish you all the best,Anxiety
i have a bad habit of thinking and worrying about what others may think of me i really want to stop it and enjoy things,thinking about what others think of us is a natural tendency human beings are social creatures and rely on feedback from the outside world of people places and things to let us know more about ourselves we also have an inner voice dialogue conscience etc that helps us to determine the path for us often when someone is worried about the external feedback and focuses on this as the sole source of information it can create a dependency that can become problematic balance is key to so many things in life your own voice is powerful and has strength to provide you the enjoyment you seek dont discount it and rely only on the voices of others,Anxiety
i have been repeating the same thought pattern for seven years and have completely lost control of any situation i am in my early s and i feel like i am trapped in my body mind soul and house because i feel embarrassed to go anywhere or talk to anyone,theres so much help for repetitive thoughts in the counseling world the one thing id for sure ask if we met in person is what those repetitive thought patterns look like some repetitive thoughts are more like obsessive thoughts for example that may mean that every time you leave a room your obsessive thought is to switch the light on and off 5 times or every time you touch a door handle you think about the germs you came into contact with and washing your hands multiple times sometimes its more about the same thoughts repeating about bad things that may happen or critical thoughts we have about ourselves your statement about feeling confident again gives me the sense that maybe you struggle with the ways in which you think about yourselfassuming its obsessive thoughts exposure and response prevention therapy is an excellent form of treatment typically obsessive thoughts influence compulsions which usually show up as very strict repetitive rituals in order to manage anxiety exposure and response prevention exposes you to the things that increase anxiety while response prevention helps you to sit through that anxiety response without performing a compulsion for example you touch a door handle your anxiety increases you obsess about the germs you came into contact with and have a strong urge to wash your hands multiple times instead you sit through the anxiety let the anxiety decrease on its own and slowly unpair that anxious response with the behavior the more you do this the more it breaks up those thinkingbehavior patterns that make you feel chained to themassuming its selfcritical thoughts cognitivebehavioral therapy can work well here everyones brain has a default track that when met with struggle plays over and over like a broken record the more you give into that the more it plays the trick here is creating a competing track or turning the volume up on a track that boosts your confidence instead of shooting it down some ways to do that are really identifying and writing down what those repetitive thoughts are you probably already know them pretty well if they repeat often then next to themwrite out a line that has an heir of confidence andor gentleness for example if your repetitive thought is that you are a failure you may write out a sentence that is something like i may be struggling greatly with this situation yet i am still trying super hard to get better and thats definitely not a failure every separate repetitive thought can have its own competing sentence initially these new thoughts will feel weird foreign and maybe even like they dont do anything give it time the repetitive thoughts have had years to grow so these new thoughts need time too they are literally new pathways in the brain and the more they are traveled the stronger they will getim also sensing that theres a combination of anxiety and depression i would assume that you are probably feeling pretty cut off from the world if you dont want to talk to anyone that can be so lonely and isolating because connection is basically crucial for healing it may be very beneficial for you to see a counselor or find a support that feels safe to you counselors are usually trained very well in these types of issues and some offer telehealth if you are having trouble leaving your home it might feel scary and strange at first but you are in a lot of pain and deserve healinghope this helps a bit go with your gut and do what you feel is right for you i wish you all the best,Anxiety
i am on the track and softball team my school is small so i play all four sports it offers i feel obligated to do track because im not a horrible runner and my dad wants me to the catch is is that the days before a track meet and the morning of i get sick and cry,seems like you have some confidence in your track abilities but feel pressured by your dad to continue something you dont really enjoy are you maybe worried about disappointing your dad or is it something about track itself that upsets you or overwhelms your bodywhen we try to push through stuff thats too much for our bodies whether thats physical or emotional that stress will show up no matter how hard we try to bury it sometimes that shows up as crying or irritation other times that shows up as physical symptoms for you it could be both based on the symptoms showing up days before a meet it could be more emotional since it comes so long beforehand im assuming you are very active already so extra exercise probably isnt too helpful and may only put more stress on your body do you feel like you ever get a chance to truly relax always running on overdrive with little gas is exhausting try giving yourself permission during the period before the track meets to just do something that slows you down doesnt have to be super longeven 1015 minutes a day could give your brain and body a very needed break from that gogogo lifestylepay attention to your sleep as well i dont know anything about your nightly routine but if you are struggling to sleep that could enhance the symptoms of anxiety before your meets some calm activities before bed could help hereof course you could try talking with your dad about whats happening if you think hed be able to support your needs thats not always possible and if not no worries theres a lot you can do to get through whats happening if you have another caregiver in the picture that feels approachable you could talk to himher about how you are feeling also take a look at strategies for performance anxiety online even if you dont have that particular type of anxiety the strategies are really great and can at least help a little if you are still engaging in track,Anxiety
i am on the track and softball team my school is small so i play all four sports it offers i feel obligated to do track because im not a horrible runner and my dad wants me to the catch is is that the days before a track meet and the morning of i get sick and cry,does anyone notice that you get sick and cry on track meet dayshave you told anyonefrom what you write as much as you would like to please your school and dad something within you doesnt quite want to fully follow throughstep one in life always is to know what you want and what your limits are it already is difficult to avoid listening to your bodytry understanding what is difficult in telling your father that youd like doing as he wishes only are not able to do so because you are emotionally and physically distraught on the days you have trackafter finishing the season for this year with your schools track team then expect to concentrate on taking care of your own need to not do trackhopefully your father will understand and care about your problem if he does not and track is more important than your well being then you have a different problem entirely,Anxiety
i am on the track and softball team my school is small so i play all four sports it offers i feel obligated to do track because im not a horrible runner and my dad wants me to the catch is is that the days before a track meet and the morning of i get sick and cry,it sounds like you are no longer committed to track emotionally it can be hard to talk to your dad about this but he may think you love track and may not know you are getting so upset the days of meets an idea would be to first write a letter to your dad to see what feelings come out and then preparing to speak with him i think he will appreciate your honesty and maybe this conversation will bring you relief and also time to find something you really will enjoy,Anxiety
im scared that my anxiety will make me say foul language i dont want to say those words though im only a teen and all my friends curse but i dont want to i dont know what to do,its definitely possible that your response to anxiety is to swear though you dont have to feel controlled by that reaction as a teen youre developing your identity based on what feels right to you and what doesnt its ok to be different than your friends and just being around swearing doesnt mean you will for sure pick up that habit what is it that connects your anxiety to swearing if it feels like your automatic response might be to curse you could try picking some words that dont go against your values to use as a default when you are upset you could also work directly with calming your anxiety maybe in ways that make you feel in control breathing exercises as well as thought replacement replacing an unhelpful thought with a helpful one are good for that whatever you try i wish you the best of luck,Anxiety
when im around people i sometimes think someone has made a comment to me or asked me to do something i will be focusing on something else and then randomly think i hear something about me i never know if it was actually said,sure can especially social anxiety or anxiety in the form of paranoia are there any patterns to when or where this happens most does it ever happen with people you feel safe and comfortable with or only when you are in an uncomfortable social setting if you notice any patterns you can focus in on the anxiety surrounding them and build coping skills to help you get through those moments if thats what would feel helpfulyou could also seek help and talk to someone about whats happening to get a better assessment of your situation and more personalized techniques theres many counselors out there that are great at working with anxiety,Anxiety
when im around people i sometimes think someone has made a comment to me or asked me to do something i will be focusing on something else and then randomly think i hear something about me i never know if it was actually said,anxiety can absolutely make you think you heard something about you when we are on high alert we tend to look for threats and often the greatest threats we experience on a daily basis are social in nature to some extent this is normal for example when people experience late onset deafness they often will worry people are talking about them and usually not good things because our brains tend to jump to that of course im not saying you are going deaf or anything just giving an example counseling can help you work through this anxiety it may also be helpful to reach out to a counselor to rule out if there may be other things going on sometimes things like paranoia can blend in with anxiety which is a very distressing experience but both are absolutely treatable wishing you the best,Anxiety
when im around people i sometimes think someone has made a comment to me or asked me to do something i will be focusing on something else and then randomly think i hear something about me i never know if it was actually said,it sounds like you are having difficulty knowing if people are saying things to you or if you only thought someone was talking to you and this is anxiety producing its understandable that it could be confusing andor a bit scary to be unsure if people are speaking to you or not its hard to say exactly what is going on from just this description but if you can work with a competent therapist you may be able to get more insight into what is happening get clarity about your social interactions and develop some ways to deal with the anxiety,Anxiety
its especially bad at night time i am scared of sleeping alone,night is hard for a lot of people so you are definitely not alone here has anything scary ever happened to you at night answering that question may give you the why of where thats coming from if you havent had a bad experience at night it may just be the time when you have nothing to do which allows more intense thoughts and feelings to surface heres a couple things to tryone thing you could do is sit down a couple hours before you go to bed and journal if you can try to reduce any distractions and just go for it the purpose of this is to slow down well before you go to bed expressing some of the anxiety from the day also take note of the things you can tackle that day vs what can wait until later this gives your brain a chance to sort through some of the planning type of anxiety that commonly comes up when you are trying to sleepanother thing you can do is make a list of the things you have control over anxiety is really good at putting everything you feel out of control of on a giant metaphorical projection screen try projecting some of the things you have control over instead for exampleyou have total control over breathing patterns what you choose to wear the next day what you pay attention to if you go for a walk etc you also have control over how you personalize that list to what matters to you mindfulness is a great way to focus on how you control your breath and also how letting go of breathing doesnt stop your body from doing what its always doing to keep you alive any google search will bring up lots of information on thissomething to remember is that experiencing anxiety is ok it doesnt mean something is necessarily wrong anxiety is sometimes just a feeling that comes up without much of a cause if you cant identify that cause its probably because of a little misinterpretation in the brain mindfulness can definitely help with that,Anxiety
its especially bad at night time i am scared of sleeping alone,being able to know you feel anxiety and write about it is the first step to addressing and handling itgenerally anxiety is deep fear of not being able to handle what comes up in life somehow the person was insufficiently nurtured and so felt insecure when very youngusually the person had to fend on at least a psychological and emotional level for themselves before reaching an age when doing so would have been reasonabletheir inner feeling of overwhelmed from when very young hasnt faced the reality that the grown person is now capable even if this takes some practice try asking yourself what you are afraid of and theorize how you would handle these situations as a grown personalso sometimes anxiety comes from feeling lonely this loneliness is reminiscent of the loneliness that the grown person now felt when being left to take care of situations as a child which were too difficult and complex for any child to address,Anxiety
im a teenager i am almost always paranoid recently i started to think they watch i keep seeing in the corner of my eye someone moving the other night i heard breathing in my room and my eyes focused on a black shape i turned on the lights but no one was there,ive worked with teens in a day treatment program for about 6 years now and its been a theme that a lot of them see dark figures out of the corner of their eyes pretty common with teens that have endured traumaphysical or sexual abuse witnessing domestic violence etc we dont have a lot of information on why this happens but its theorized that the brain projects the emotions outside of us in the form of dark figuresmaybe just as a reflection of what is existing on the inside of the brain or even to give some emotional relief when we have kids that have experienced those types of hallucinations they almost always disappear once they have worked through their trauma sometimes visual and auditory hallucinations are symptoms of mental health disorders as well though thats pretty rare for those to start as early as the teens years its best to have your symptoms checked out by a medical professional and maybe even a psychiatrist to get a better idea of what may be happening are you or have you been taking any medications that could potentially have these side effects if you do visit one or both professionals make sure you or a caregiver is giving them all the details about your symptoms so they can help you as much as possiblea big question here is what is your sleep like lack of sleep is notorious for causing hallucinations and can become severe after only a few nights of sleep deprivation if you are having trouble sleeping that may be another topic to discuss with your doctorno matter what it is its obviously scary otherwise you wouldnt feel paranoid try some techniques to calm yourself a few times during the day like deep breathing or movementbased strategies like yoga whatever speaks to you and remember that while you are figuring this issue out the hallucinations cant hurt you even if they get strongerglad you are reaching out to get some help,Anxiety

ive been like this ever since i was in school back then i transferred to another school now im thinking about changing my job,its great that you are at least aware of what pushes you to seek change in your lifeif you were in session with me one of the first things id explore is what tough means for you is it relationship issues with other people or tasks related to your job or is it something else its important to know what you may be trying to escape in order to work with it for example if you tend to make changes when you are faced with a commitment then there would be something about commitment that scared you and the work would be focused there one thing to think about is that most people tend to run from things that they believe they cant handle or get through could this be happening in your situation if it is there could be some underlying fears present that you are incompetent or you will fail whats interesting about that is that some people avoid change for the very same reasons its actually quite amazing that you handle so much change in your life and have for a very long time that shows you can handle a lot the last thought i have is that the more you push through the tough stuff the more you will have confidence in your ability to do that you dont have to feel confident to start the processin fact many people feel very vulnerable and terrified sticking with decisions that are out of their comfort zone having social support even if its just one person is so important when youre facing your fears that could mean counseling or a partner friend family member etc doing it alone is another level of toughyou may be at the point in your life where you are just seeking some answers and arent feeling ready to address whats happening and thats ok no one wants to go blindly into this kind of work theres no rush to figure it all out right now give yourself some time to let things unfold,Anxiety

i have these dreams of men and they always seem to try to hurt me its gotten so bad that i first wake at  then  and finally stay awake by  im always the last one to fall asleep and the first to wake i hate falling asleep the longest ive went without sleep is three days,no wonder you are scared to sleep if this is what you are going throughmy first thought is that its possible your dreams are your brains way of trying to process something that scares you or has scared you theres not a lot of research on the purpose of dreams but one theory is that stuff you dont want to deal with consciously is able to come through via your unconscious brain as a dream or nightmare another theory is more of gestalt nature where all your dream figures represent a part of youfor example the part of you being attacked would be the side of you that feels weak whereas the attacker is the side of you that you feel is bad or evil either way your reactions are definitely legit because nightmares tend to flood the brain in a pretty emotionally raw formi am also curious if you had trouble sleeping before you started having these dreams is it because of these nightmares that sleep is an issue or have the sleep issues been a part of your life longer than the dreams it may not mean a whole lot no matter what order they came in but it would be interesting to know if the catalyst was actually the dreams to begin with the big question here is if not having these nightmares would improve your sleep and lessen your anxiety about sleeping overallas for the anxiety attacks theres a lot here you can try your brain is seeing sleep nightmares or both as a threat the way to signal safety to your brain is to practice some relaxation techniquesmindful breathing can be helpful or if you find it hard to sit still you can do some walking mindfulness maybe youve heard of the calm appits so great for sleep issues they have sleep stories and soundscapes as well as guided breathing exercises this is speaking more to the thinking process but remind yourself that the dreams arent real and they cant hurt you that doesnt mean you wont have anxiety and you have to fully believe it it just means that you dont have to get caught up in the fear response you also mention that they try to hurt you have you ever done things to fight them off or do you run its ok if your response is to freezeim just curious how you view yourself in that dream if you are feeling powerless which would be normal it may be worth your time to imagine how you want to fight them off what weapons would you choose what would escape look like imagining you in charge may help change your experience of the dreamsalso remember that even though panic attacks feel awful they wont hurt you its a really terrifying feeling to be trapped in your body during an attack but the response is meant to get us out of danger even though there is no real threat if you do a google search for panic attack help sites theres so many that detail more of this response and how to move through an attack of course seeing a counselor might be beneficial if you are sensing that theres something bigger underlying the dreams sometimes just having someone listen and understand can ease some sufferingi hope that helps and you find something that works for you,Anxiety
i have these dreams of men and they always seem to try to hurt me its gotten so bad that i first wake at  then  and finally stay awake by  im always the last one to fall asleep and the first to wake i hate falling asleep the longest ive went without sleep is three days,that is awful i am sure you are ready to start getting some rest its normal for us to wake a few times in the night however when we are dealing with high anxiety or stress those times can turn into being up most night given that you are having these repeated dreams i am wondering what might be going on in your life either now or in the past that could be triggering stress or maybe memories it can help to draw the dream out in the morning or even to look for metaphor in the long run seeking counseling can help you sort all that outin the meantime selfsoothing strategies may help you in the night when you wake and cant get back to sleep this can be anything with your sensesgetting a snack like tea and focusing on that taste smelling something pleasant listening to some relaxing music looking through a magazine taking a shower anything you can think of that might help you relax if it involves needing to get up thats okay getting out of bed can actually help you get out of that mind space and helps you associate your bed with relaxationsleep vs anxiety making it more likely you will fall asleep once you lay down,Anxiety

ive been having horrible anxiety for the last week i cant sleep i get a sense of doom and its hard to breathe i feel like nothing i do makes it better,that really sucks to go through there are tons of ways to work with anxiety both directly and indirectly that can help with what you are dealing withdo you think you may be experiencing a panic attack sounds like you are feeling some dread about what will happen to you and physical symptoms common with attacks panic attacks are the bodys way of trying to alert you to danger whether that is real or perceived its not something your body does against you but instead to keep you safe by keeping you in a state where you could react quickly run fight etc this can happen even if there arent any real threats and you logically know you are safe even if you arent having panic attacks that heightened anxiety can still feel really awful and exhaustingwhat have you done so far that is not working when the brain is in that danger mode talking it down tends to be unsuccessfulthis is very evident in bounds of research we have on how the brain functions the part of the brain that senses threats and triggers anxiety responses reacts more effectively to body signals to relaxsuch as controlled breathing mindfulness breathing techniques have a lot of value for this reason and there are many options available apps like calm and headspace youtube guided videos etc try to keep in mind that having anxiety doesnt mean that you are actually in any danger and mindfulness is not meant to be an escape it does help to regulate and make you feel more in control of your body your anxiety will always come back downyou can even track it to see the realtime changes that happen its normal for it to rise and fall a few times during a panic attack so if you notice a rise it has no meaning other than that youre body is normally going through its anxiety responsei think seeing a doctor is a great idea to rule out any other issues happening within the body some medical issues can materialize as anxiety and depression depending on your symptoms they may even suggest a medication developed for these issuesanxiety is one of the top researched symptoms so we do have tons of research available on what works and whats less effective we know that talking alone doesnt reduce the bodys fear response unless talking is the method of exposure talking about a traumatic experience talking within a group if you have social anxiety etc for the brain to learn you are safe it takes experience via exposure while riding the wave of anxiety for example if you fear vomiting you would expose yourself to things that remind you of vomiting and breathe through the anxiety you feel without avoiding the triggers that would teach your brain that those triggers are actually benign and would no longer create that panicky response itd be difficult to say what that may look like for you or even if you need that but it could be worth connecting with a counselor even online to discuss these options the brain is always flexible to some degree to change so hang in there while you figure it all out,Anxiety
ive been having horrible anxiety for the last week i cant sleep i get a sense of doom and its hard to breathe i feel like nothing i do makes it better,anxiety is usually a sign of a current problem to which familiar emotional patterns of feeling similarly upset attach themselvestry to understand more about who you are what you like feel uneasy about especially your deeper emotions of being emotionally harmed or injured by meaningful peopleanxiety is best addressed indirectly by understanding and kindly accepting previous hurt and fears from long agoonce you feel at ease with dynamics of past situations then the current anxiety will decrease this is because you will have adjusted and found new ways of handling otherwise frightening and overwhelming interactions and involvements with others,Anxiety
i am a female and in my early teens i dont want to feel afraid of people when i meet someone i know that they are okay but i still feel afraid,first off this is totally expected for someone your age you are just moving into the phase of life where your job is to figure out your identity and who you are its no surprise you are afraid of people if thats the way you feel you are strugglingif you are worried about people harming you that paints a different picture do you struggle to trust your evaluations of others what makes someone safe ish vs potentially dangerous sitting down and coming up with some ways you have done this in the past or qualities of the people you trust now can help to disentangle what means safety and what means danger we can never truly know how someone will behave but if we always choose to never trust then we miss out on connection as well your brain is still growing so the great news is its so flexible to change it remains flexible for the entire lifespan but the teen years are really the last time its so moldable if theres someone in your life you can trust reaching out for help can make how you are feeling less intense its never fun to deal with everything by yourself hope this helps,Anxiety
i am a female and in my early teens i dont want to feel afraid of people when i meet someone i know that they are okay but i still feel afraid,maybe the problem is learning to trust yourself to not be afraid other peoplereflect on what you believe would increase your trust of believing your own judgement on whom to trustif youve had any type of violation during your growing up years or witnessed someone in your family be violated emotionally physically or through some terrible accident or incident then you may hesitate to believe other people are safe and not to be fearedgive yourself plenty of time and reassurance that as long as you are making sincere effort to increase you comfort around other people eventually you will succeed,Anxiety
when i get talked to by my dad or stepmom or if im in trouble i will begin to cry and not say whats wrong with me when my dad or stepmom ask what is wrong i never know the answers or the words to put together what is actually wrong with me,i really admire that you want to express yourself to your parents its very normal to have fear about how to talk to a parent let alone two at the same time most adults dont do what you want to docould you come up with what you want to say to them before you are feeling upset what do you really need them to know also do you want your dad and stepmom to meet certain emotional needs for you maybe they would benefit from knowing that you have a hard time expressing yourself when you are upset and can help to come up with ways to help you through that perhaps you need some space from them when you are crying or maybe you need to talk to one parent alone vs both at the same time you dont have to wait to be upset to have these conversations eitherif you feel you can approach them when things are calm whatever that means for your household it may be easier to communicateits important to know they may not respond the way you want its up to you to decide if you feel safe or not to express yourself but it seems like you want to if you are seeking an answer for this dilemma,Anxiety

a lot of times i avoid situations where i am to meet new people because i have a fear of embarrassing myself i often avoid large groups of people like parties because i think they all constantly judge me,hello and thank you for your question first i want you to know that you are certainly not alone on this issue everyone at some point in time has a fear of public embarrassment but for many people this fear can become so awful that it begins to have a real negative impact on their quality of life they will try to avoid any situation that they even think will cause them embarrassment or anxiety escaping a possible embarrassing moment by avoiding or isolating may cause some relief at first but then many times the avoidance will eventually lead to loneliness isolation and even despair by avoiding we can also miss out on things that make us feel alive and bring enjoyment there are many selfhelp books that offer advice on this issue you can do an internet search and i recommend reading the reviews of the book that is great way to find out if others have found the book helpful another option is to seek a counselor to help you with this fear i would recommend a counselor who specializes in helping people who have anxiety or social anxiety acceptance and commitment therapy is a good choice for helping with anxiety but there are many others the truth is that anxiety and fear of embarrassing ourselves is not something that any of us will ever get over but we can learn to respond to those feelings differently a colleague may offer some other advice as well be wellrobin landwehr dbh lpc ncc,Anxiety
a lot of times i avoid situations where i am to meet new people because i have a fear of embarrassing myself i often avoid large groups of people like parties because i think they all constantly judge me,when i talk with clients about social anxiety sometimes ill ask them what they would do if their anxiety was manageable would you want to be more social would that improve you quality of relationships in your life these answers can clarify what you want your life to look like and how much socialization you are truly interested inits normal to have thoughts and fears about what others are thinking of us otherwise wed be pretty shameless in our behavior even though we feel as though we are in the spotlight the truth is that most people are not focused on us theres hundreds of thousands of stimuli the brain processes especially at a party and you are a very small percentage of that think about it this wayif you are at a party with a bunch of other people why would you be in center stage vs anyone else at that party when people are worried about embarrassment or judgment they typically act in ways to be less visible in public chances are people notice you less than they notice others simply because of avoidance behaviorsi dont think its needed to attend every social event because who has the energy for that but pushing yourself to engage can teach your brain that you can push yourself through these events the more you avoid the more your brain will because the situation is something to fear if you can stick with someone you trust or connect to that could help you to enjoy the experience more and frame it somewhat positivelyif you really struggle on your own you could visit a counselor and work on some strategies that fit for you,Anxiety
a lot of times i avoid situations where i am to meet new people because i have a fear of embarrassing myself i often avoid large groups of people like parties because i think they all constantly judge me,why not accept and tolerate that you naturally are a shy person who doesnt like large groupsthis is not necessarily something to get over if it is part of who you arepeople have the capacity to judge others regardless of whether the group is large or smallif you arent afraid of being judged in small groups then study the factors which allow you to feel safe in small groups possibly you can generalize your findings to large group venuesif you try the and arent successful then likely you simply arent naturally someone who cares for large group settingsnot everything a person doesnt like is a symptom of something is wrong w the person,Anxiety
ive been on  mg of xanax twice a day for the past month it hasnt been helping me at all but when i take  mg during a big anxiety attack it calms me down i was wondering how i can ask my psychologist to up the dose to  mg twice a day without her thinking im abusing them i just have very big anxiety attacks should i stay on the mg and deal with the attacks or should i ask to up the dose im afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else,it seems like what you are looking for is a way to advocate for yourself and thats so important in mental health you know best what is working for you and what isnt so you are the best person to speak out for yourself to the people that can help you i have extensive training in substance abuse and medications used in therapy and i work with many people that take xanax counselors may not prescribe but with the right training we can educate and help you move through the complexities of medication usage when paired with therapy theres definitely some debate about using medication in the counseling world but many people are prescribed xanax to cope with big emotional responses we dont know much about your situation hereif you are in counseling what types of other coping skills youve tried to use etc so itd be hard to suggest not taking anything for your symptoms you are obviously struggling and sometimes stabilization is the best you can do and the fact that you are considering dealing with the attacks as an option is a sign you are willing to negotiate your dosage and maybe even the intense fear you are experiencing thats seriously so courageousa little bit about xanaxxanax is a drug in the benzodiazepine family and is fastacting that means it does only help shortterm but your body also builds a tolerance to it pretty quickly just as people build tolerance to alcohol that could be why they arent as effective for you at the dosage you are taking especially if you are prescribed to take them twice a day its really important that you discuss the symptoms you are still having with your prescribing provider as well as when you are taking the medications so they understand the details of your situation and can determine if or how to modify your dosage these providers know a lot about the medication process and the more info they have the better they can meet your needs they are ultimately the ones that will work with you to decide whether or not xanax is the best for you and your situationi definitely understand your concern that your provider may basically take away how you cope with panic attacks thats a scary thought prescribing providers are typically trained in detecting medication abuse and it is very common for people with anxiety issues to request higher dosages i have had plenty of clients ask for increased dosage not only can this get you the assistance you need at the time you need it but give you a voice in your treatment you may end up using that same voice for request to lower your dosage in the futurei do feel an ethical duty to let you know about some of the dangers of xanax benzodiazepines are depressants and work on the central nervous system cns to do things like slow down your heart rate breathing etc as you can feel when they do work they should never be taken with any other depressants such as alcohol barbiturates and other medications in the benzo family combinations like these could be fatalanother danger is that theres a common pattern of relapse after discontinuing xanax this means that symptoms tend to come back stronger than they were before taking the drug the reason for this is because when you are taking xanax your brain tries to intensify your fear reaction to override the drug so when you discontinue it your fear reactions are still at those heightened levels your prescribing provider can talk to you more about that andor the process of tapering off the medication to make that less likely when that time comes for youif you are in counseling and doing exposure activities being exposed to things you fear and sitting through the anxiety response xanax does interfere with this process the brain cant learn a different response if you feel calm this is something your counselor if you have one can discuss with you as wellthe last thing id like to say is that there could be some value to practicing other ways to manage your anxiety if you want to make more longterm changes that decision is completely yours ifwhen you feel ready to do that a counselor can help you learn how to move through anxiety without being as reliant on xanax i hope this is helpful and you find what you need,Anxiety

i just about fall asleep then i cant help but sit up and walk around,this is very common sleep is when we are most vulnerable and it requires our bodies to let go of control and lose awareness of a lot of our environment has anything bad ever happened to you at night or when you were sleeping this could be something to consider your body may be feeling a need to protect you by not letting you relax and instead keeping you awake and aware to anything around youcould you be worrying about what is happening the following day its also normal to have pressures of the next day rolling through our minds before our bodies commit to sleep if you pay attention to what you are thinking about before bed that could tell you a lot about what you worry about in your lifenot everyone is into meditation or mindfulness but these methods can help send the message to your brain that you are safe there are some pretty neat apps like calm and headspace or mindfulness videos on youtube that have a variety of tools to fit what you may need it may take a while for these to really start to show results so keep at it if you have the chancejournaling can also be a great way to release some of the stress from the day and silence the mind a bit consulting with a doctor may also be a plus if your sleep continues to be impacted not having proper sleep can lead to more anxiety and reduce the bodys capabilities to regulate emotion leading to worsened sleep sometimes having a buffer there can help get your sleep on a better track while you work on the anxiety hope you find some of this helpful,Anxiety

im just an extremely paranoid person i constantly feel as though i am in some sort of danger like as though i live in a horror movie with no resolution it worsens at night it gets to the point im scared in my own home more so than anything i have no access to the help i need so im desperate,that really sucks and im sorry thats happening to youim curious what kind of paranoia you are experiencinglike someone will hurt you that something bad in general will happen sometimes intrusive thoughts like paranoid thoughts are just thoughts they dont mean you are actually in danger or that something bad will happen so pay attention to the meaning you apply to those thoughts if youve been through something traumatic such as rape domestic violence or any situation like that it could provoke paranoia bigtime your brain feels as if it has to be hypervigilant meaning it has to be extra attuned to everything around you to keep you safe thats exhausting if its worse at night that probably means you arent getting much sleepalso exhausting and contributes to heightened paranoia so it becomes a pretty vicious cycleits not shocking that its worse at night because night is generally a scarier time and sleeping is physically when we are in our most vulnerable state it can help to take a look at how much of that paranoia is actually helping you to protect yourself vs how much is additional stress a way to figure that out is to ask the question what behaviors are necessary to keep you safe so if you lock your doors lock the windows shut the curtains have an escape plan if neededim not sure what your situation is is that the most you can do beyond that are you performing other behaviors that may not be keeping you safe but exist to cope with the paranoia for example if you are checking over and over to make sure the doors and windows are locked those behaviors are more like compulsionsrituals that help you feel safe by reducing anxiety even though they use a ton of energy to perform response prevention can be helpful herethis method involves avoiding your usual response so that you can sit with the anxiety rather than escaping it through the behaviors lets say your anxiety rises and you feel the need to check the door lock you check the lock its for sure locked and your anxiety is reduced at the same time the behavior of checking the lock is reinforced by feeling better so your brain decides if you want to feel better you need to check the lock it becomes an exhausting habit that only temporarily makes you feel safe however if you feel a bout of anxiety and sit through it without checking the lock your anxiety will go back down and your brain learns that you dont need to perform that behavior over and over im so sad to hear you dont have access to help there may be some counselors right now offering reducedrate or probono free sessions via telehealth due to covid19 so if you search around on google for your specific state you may find someone that can help you from your home counselors usually reserve space on their schedules for people that cannot afford therapy or need a lesser rateyou are always welcome to come back to this forum and ask additional questions,Anxiety

i shake and have panic attacks,so glad you are reaching out panic attacks are very frighteningfor some reason and i promise there is one your brain is sending off false alarms even though you are probably safe this is called the fight or flight response and part of the bodys way of fighting off perceived threats including those that are not genuinely dangeroussome reasons people have panic attacks is if they are under too much emotional or physical stress any type of exhaustion or lack of sleep history of trauma unprocessed emotions etc you dont have to know why you are having panic attacks to work with them but it can help to understand its origins and target them at the sourcesomething to know is that the presence of anxiety does not mean you are in any danger no matter how much your body is elevated anxiety is just our bodys way of letting us know something is off though it often exaggerates the response because it doesnt always operate from a place of logic triggers could be as small as a word smell time of day or really anything triggers can also be physical sensations inside our bodies though panic attacks are very scary and feel incredibly uncomfortable they will not kill youwhat message might your body be sending you via panic attacks is there any area of your life you could step away from at all to give yourself some relief if you pay attention to when panic attacks happen that could clue you into what is setting off that false alarmsome apps that are really great for relaxation and use breathing techniques are calm headspace panicshield etc try some out and see which ones really fit for your needs breathing is a great tool because you always have it right there with you and its something you can control when it feels like your body is out of control,Anxiety
i shake and have panic attacks,one way to understand panic attacks is as a sign of feeling insecure or lacking confidence in a certain area or characteristic of yourselfthe insecurity can sometimes feel overwhelming and this starts the sense of panic one way to build your sense of security within yourself is to have a simple life and a slow paced life when there are many activities or involvements to pay attention then it is easy to not give full attention to all of them this may trigger a sense of insecurity since in fact you may not have had sufficient time to study and know your own opinion about all of what your life is immersed ina simpler life of fewer activities allows more time to know and understand your own inner feelings and reactionsto know more about yourself may help build your confidence and security in your ability to know and live what goes on in your life,Anxiety
i shake and have panic attacks,one of the first things i would suggest is to see if you can keep track of what is leading you to feel anxious if you shake all the time consider talking with your primary care physician sometimes that can be a hormonal imbalance or another chemical imbalance such as thyroidone of the most difficult things about anxiety is that having anxiety particularly panic attacks can lead to anxiety about having more panic attacks also remember that panic attacks are typically part of your brains protective response to what it considers to be some sort of threat you may have heard of the fight or flight response when you have an anxiety attack your body is preparing you to react to something that isnt actually a threat so its almost as if youre fight or flight response is overactive here is an image that may be helpful httppsychologytoolsfightorflightresponsehtmlthere are many different things you can do you can practice breathing mindfulness meditation or yoga techniques if you decide to try some breathing techniques try breathing in for a count of five holding for a count of five breathing out for a count of five and repeating five timesalso remember that it is easier to learn these techniques when youre not having a panic attack at that point it can be really difficult to use methods to not panic also remember that panic attacks typically last 5 to 10 minutes using techniques to slow your breathing or become focused on the room around you is probably most helpful when you first start to feel anxioushere are some other techniques that may help to decrease anxiety httppsychcentralcomlib9waystoreduceanxietyrighthererightnowas you figure out what is leading up to your anxiety also consider asking yourself what is making that certain issue a big concern for you another important question could be when you have felt that way before,Anxiety

i am a peaceful person but i often find myself having thoughts about killing people eventhough i like the thoughts at the time they make me cry why do i feel like this,let me point a couple things out to you these thoughts obviously go against your core values otherwise they wouldnt upset you having thoughts about killing people bugs you and thats a good sign you are also concerned enough to reach out on this chat forum that tells me you have put some time into worrying about these thoughts and what they meantheres absolutely nothing wrong with a thought we all have extreme thoughts in life because our brains are built to wander unless you are acting on these thoughts they are not dangerous its important to note that having a thought doesnt mean you are that thought its pretty easy to assume that our thoughts are who we are but that couldnt be less true if we were our thoughts wed be so many different things at once itd be unimaginablesomething i wonder is if these thoughts feel intrusive to you even if you enjoy them do they seem to show up without invitation when a thought is intrusive in nature it can often make someone feel as if it is uncontrollable and holds more weight than less intrusive thoughts it is also interesting that you mention finding pleasure in thinking about killing in the sense that its definitely giving you some psychological relief in the moment from that i have two thoughts 1 could it mean you are trying to cope with something socially upsetting to you via these types of thoughts and 2 im wondering if there is any repressed anger in your life you mention being a peaceful person are you usually the peacemaker in your social world do you feel as if people take advantage of you or that you dont have a voice those situations can breed anger and resentment if you dont allow yourself to feel or express anger the brain will find a way to do it for you and its not weird or strange that it would want to send out thoughts that clearly get your attentionanother thing you could try is tracking when the thoughts come up keeping a log can help shed light on what may be triggering them and what their purpose may seem to bewishing you all the best,Anxiety
i am a peaceful person but i often find myself having thoughts about killing people eventhough i like the thoughts at the time they make me cry why do i feel like this,maybe because you have great emotional pain stored inside you of which you are not aware existssometimes people who feel greatly hurt by others or who feel unloved by others imagine if they do the opposite of love which is to kill that they will get the recognition and acknowledgement from others which they wish would come to them in a loving waythis is my theory it is not necessarily a definitive description of your inner dynamicmost important is to keep an open mind to selfdiscovery on your feelings including the ones which are uneasy such as killing to consider,Anxiety
i am a peaceful person but i often find myself having thoughts about killing people eventhough i like the thoughts at the time they make me cry why do i feel like this,hello and thank you for your question clearly this is something that has you very concerned sometimes thoughts are just thoughts and they are pretty harmless many people have thoughts of killing someone but they would never actually do it they really dont even want to do it they are just having a thought other times thoughts are a sign of something more serious and we should receive help when they start to worry us i would recommend meeting with a counselor to discuss these thoughts it is usually a safe environment where you can get advice with little judgement now if you begin to start thinking about killing someone specific and making a plan to do it in reality you should call for help immediately by help i mean 911 or a family member or friend you would want to get help before doing something to harm yourself and others again none of this is to judge but rather to encourage you to get the help youre seeking either way when we become concerned about some aspect of our behavior seeking counseling is usually a good choice be well robin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc,Anxiety

i get very nervous and anxiousscared before sex,tell your partner about this so that ideally the person has a chance to be supportive and reassuring as well as listen to your specific worries and fearsinitiate this type of discussion at a time which is removed from the time youre about to have sexthis way you and your partner both have a chance to realize the two of you are having a discussion not a prelude to sexif you meant in your question that you feel anxious about having sex w a random partner then maybe you are less interested in hookup sex than you imagined,Anxiety
i get very nervous and anxiousscared before sex,i first wonder what your anxiety or fear connects to i dont know whether it is about sex itself or about ideas of worthiness or feeling desirablethere is also a difference between having selfdoubt about the actual physicality of having sex performancerelated or having doubts about whether you want to have sex with a particular personhaving sex can lead to feelings of great vulnerability if your partner is someone you trust consider discussing what it is that comes up for you around the issue of sex this is the certain things that your partner would be willing to do that and the ease your discomfort like staying with you for some time before and after sexual interactionsanother idea to consider is spending time with your partner and using nonsexual touch for each other perhaps first you to him and then him to you and communicating very clearly about what you like and do not like some people like to be spoken to during physical touch and other people do not all of this can be part of your discussions when you feel comfortable with that you could move into sexual touch in this manner and actually look at what you do and do not like you may also consider discussing things that are totally offlimits for you all the time and things for which you would like warning or awareness before they happen there are really a number of different ways to work on becoming more comfortable if you trust your partner and if your concern is about sex itselfif this feels pretty structured it is initially generally the idea is to learn more about each other and yourselves and then the process becomes much more naturalif the concern relates more to selfesteem related sex consider asking your partner to list several things that he or she likes about you even if you dont necessarily see yourself in the same light consider that this is how your partner sees you so these are some of the things that make you attractive to them perhaps both in sexual ways and in a wider discussion of the relationshipif this is difficult for you to sort out on your own consider seeing a therapist with experience working with couples or relationships,Anxiety

why am i so afraid of it i dont understand,your fear is somewhat reasonable no one wants to be raped and i imagine everyone is afraid of what being raped would feel likedo you mean that this fear is on your mind more often than you would likeif this is the case then try understanding the reason behind your fearis it because you personally know or know of someone who was raped one general direction of what would help is to regain confidence in your decisions of keeping yourself safe the more you trust yourself to avoid social situations with lots of drinking isolated physical surroundings and being in isolated locations with someone with whom youre not very familiar probably your fear will decreasethe other general direction to understand is if in your family history people have been violated severely either emotionally mentally or physicallyin families in which people have suffered severe violations of themselves often the emotional patterning of expecting to be hurt by others plants itself very deeply and transmits to the younger generationits possible then that you are suffering from fears established in other family members who have not yet been able to fully understand and accept their own sufferingthe good news is that individual therapy with a credentialed and licensed therapist is ideal for a safe place to open and clear this type of emotional burden,Anxiety

my boyfriend and i have been dating for almost a year we go to different schools and we dont see each other that often i just feel very paranoid that theres someone else or that he could be hiding something from me,have you spoken to him about your fears perhaps you can explain this feeling to him and let him know what might lead to feeling more secure also it is important to trust your intuition perhaps there are good reasons to feel concerned it may not be paranoia  it may be based in reality,Anxiety
my boyfriend and i have been dating for almost a year we go to different schools and we dont see each other that often i just feel very paranoid that theres someone else or that he could be hiding something from me,paranoid is a mental disorder word that is a strong word i think to use in this situation honestly the bottom like is either you dont trust him for some reason or you are insecure with yourself which is it do some soul searching to help you figure which one it is work on either discussing why you dont trust him and work on building that trust or why you feel you are not good enough and work on that,Anxiety
im concerned about my boyfriend i suffer from anxiety but i always have this feeling he wants to hurt me because he told me he was interested in bdsm intercourse we havent tried it but ive had this feeling he always wants to,hello thank you for your question there are few things that people find more personal than their sexual relationships when we feel connected to our partner sex can be best thing since sliced bread however if we feel disconnected in some way sex can feel degrading and even painful i dont know the specifics about your relationship or how comfortable you are in talking to your boyfriend but this is one of those situations where communicating your fears is a good idea the only exception to that would be if you believe he is actually a threat to you in some way if you believe that then you should do whatever you think is safe it sounds like there is a part of you that is already afraid of him and if that is the case then remaining safe is your top priority assuming you are able to share with him your feelings telling him what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriate and sexually healthy sex is something that is supposed to be enjoyable for all parties all parties should feel respected and able to say no to absolutely anything they are not comfortable with i call the respectful agreement between sexual partners sex trust sex trust means your partner respects your boundaries it means they wont degrade you sexually with hurtful words forced sex or forcing or coercing sex in ways someone is not interested in having your personal safety and mental wellbeing is what is most important now if there is a part of you that is curious about bdsm and may be interested in participating in it there are many websites that you can explore to learn information i will warn you some websites and articles are better or worse than others but you may at least feel more informed many people engage in bdsm and have happy relationships but again it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants it is also important to know that bdsm is not just one thing and people practice it differently based on comfort if it is something you are uncomfortable with then you shouldnt feel obligated to do it i hope this was helpful be well robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc,Anxiety
i get so much anxiety and i dont know why i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes,this is a very common question in my practice panic attacks typically emerge from an underlying issue ex depression low selfesteem fears to decrease your anxiety symptoms its recommended to seek treatment with a therapist who specializes in working with anxiety disorders and most importantly one with whom you feel comfortable within my practice i educate clients about their anxiety and discuss building a framework with helpful tools for decreasing anxiety1 starting a daily mindfulness practice for example listening to guided meditation engaging in deep breathing exercises yoga practice or other positive calming activities2 understand your negative and positive thoughts many times we tend to focus on the potential for bad things to happen increase positive selftalk when feeling down or when anxious for example i dont need to worry i am calm and relaxed 3 exposure to fearful or anxious situations this can be accomplished under the care of a mental health professional many times we shy away from things that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure this may led to an increase in isolating behaviors resulting in difficulty in performing things we were once able to do for example leaving the house presenting in front of others going to social events and having conversations with people however the more we expose ourselves and practice the use of our positive coping skills ex deep breathing the chances of anxiety will decrease i hope this was helpful keep in mind a therapist can help with guiding you through self relaxation and improvement,Anxiety
i get so much anxiety and i dont know why i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes,the other two post answers to your question are very good and i dont feel the need to repeat what has already been said quite well but i will offer one other option i have been able to utilize quite successfully with those dealing with panic attacks chain analysis is a fantastic way for your to map out the situation starting with the prompting event the chain of events links that lead up to the behavior  in this case a panic attack and then what the consequences were see the illustration belowthis is very useful in that it lays everything out for you to see so that it becomes possible to alter one of the links leading up to the unwanted behavior panic attack allows you to come up with strategies for similar situations prompting events and allows you to understand how you are reinforcing the behavior when it does occur consequences finally  it would also allow you to identify any particular vulnerabilities such as not enough sleep poor nutrition trauma history or having a cold the time it occurred working with someone who utilizes a behavioral approach such as dbt or behavioral analysis you can find solutions that replace one of the links and therefore breaks the chain of events,Anxiety
i get so much anxiety and i dont know why i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes,anxiety is simply your system communicating to you that you are in danger the issue that i see in most of my clients is that they try to reason with this anxiety you do not reason with sensory states in the body if your system tells your in danger your stomache feels like it is knots your heart is beating out of your chest validate by just being present with it take your breath to it breath in and out of that space say ok i am in danger i always tell my clients a crying baby wants to be held not told to shut up listen to your system validate it like you do a child and see what happens,Anxiety
i get so much anxiety and i dont know why i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes,the are two ways that such anxiety can be dealt with one is an attempt to replace maladaptive thinking by examining the distorted thinking and resetting the fightorflight response with more reasonable accurate ones as an example im scared of spiders but if you change the thinking from being scared to im bigger than the spider it allows the mind to reach a calmer state of mind mindfulnessbased therapy can also help focus on the bodily sensations that arise when you feel anxious instead of avoiding or withdrawing from these feelings remain present and fully experience the symptoms of anxiety instead of avoiding distressing thoughts open up to them in an effort to realize and acknowledge that they are not literally truealthough it may seem counterintuitive fully realizing the experience of anxiety enables the release of over identification with negative thoughts you can practice responding to disruptive thoughts and letting these thoughts goby remaining present in the body youll learn that the anxiety being experienced is merely a reaction to perceived threats by positively responding to threatening events instead of being reactive you can overcome an erroneous fightorflight response,Anxiety

whenever i have to speak in public or be in big crowds i freak out i get lightheaded sweaty and i have trouble breathing,basically your response is the fight flight or freeze reaction which is hard wired into the human nervous system specifically the autonomic nervous system called the autonomic response this system is responsible for regulating the heart digestion respiratory rate as well as other aspects which match the symptoms you describe it is largely an unconscious function but with training it can be managed such as a public speaking course in which you prepare and even have some exposure to smaller experiences to help you prepare and cope for larger presentations one of the greatest applications of addressing this response is the nasa program which exposes the astronauts to situations they will encounter while in space which will trigger the response so that when it does happen not if but when that they are able to move through the challenge with success you can learn more about his by going to ted talks what i learned about going blind in space it is a truly inspiring look at what you are experiencing as well as how to deal with it with that being said finding a program like a dale carnegie public speaking program can help working with a counselor who can help you utilize visualization of an upcoming speech has been shown to help and you can always talk to your doctor to see what options might be available there as well good luck,Anxiety

ive been experiencing a lot of anxiety and panic attacks lately i was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with obsessivecompulsive disorder lately ive been questioning everything from my career to my relationship my boyfriend and i just moved in a few months ago all of a sudden i dont feel as comfortable around him as i used to although i cant seem to find a reason as to why i feel this way,how is your boyfriend responding to your discomfort around himhas he told you that hes noticed changes in youthe good news about a relationship is that you can talk about matters with the other person doing so can only help clarify feelings and what either of you expect from the relationship given that the two of you recently moved in together it is natural for new dynamics feelings and expectations to arise it just adds to the reasonableness of talking with each other about how living together feels to each of youpsychiatrists earn their living by diagnosing people and telling them to take pills very often just being told the person has a condition makes them feel fragile and less capable than they actually areanxiety and panic attacks do mean that there is a great deal of emotion and situation needing to be addressedit is the normal sign of having to address many or deep matters be patient and give yourself time to learn the details of your relationship and whatever the career particulars are that are bothering you youre apparently selfaware since youre the one describing your own problematic situations keep the label of being disordered aside psychiatry labels do more good for psychiatrists than they do for people who are trying to live their lives,Anxiety

i have lately been having lots of anxiety and selfloathing about the fact that i am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before it seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore and i just had my first kiss five months ago im worried that at this rate i wont have a boyfriend for a very long time the problem is that i want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me but at the same time i dont want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex i have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them luckily they were nice guys but none of them wanted a relationship with me i feel dirty by doing this but i feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal most people are surprised when they find out that i am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think i am really good looking i am tall i play lots of sports and i get excellent grades in school i am in my first year of university right now and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest it bothers me most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already i feel like i will be single forever sometimes,hi winters im so glad you wrote because i think there are a lot of young women experiencing the exact same thing you feel selfloathing for both being a virgin and for being sexually active young women have always gotten crazy mixed messages about what theyre supposed to be they feel pressure to be pure and they also feel pressure to be the vixen and please men sexually but you cant be both so you cant ever win if you buy into all that horse manure excuse my language this current hookup culture puts added pressure on girls to expect nothing more than random sexual encounters that leave you feeling empty and used perhaps desirable in that moment but mostly worthless the stupid part is that research tells us that young men are also impacted negatively by this cultural norm that values sex and not relationship they feel guilt and loneliness i urge you to talk to other girls and women about your feelings my hope and prayer is that they will echo my words hereyour value and power cannot ever be found in whether a man wants you whether you turn his eye or how he treats you your sexuality is a beautiful part of who you are and it is to be celebrated i love that you want to celebrate it with someone who cares who you are is so very much more than your sexuality you sound like you have a lot of things going for you try to see all of those things when you think of yourselfthere are many more virgins out there and many are afraid like you that they dont fit in we are all different and you dont have to be anything but who you want to be who you are you dont have to have any kind of sex until youre ready and that makes you brave and smart not weirdyoure tall and beautiful and guys may be intimidated by that it may take time for you to meet the right guy but hes out there the question is how do you want to spend your time until he crosses your path i hope you talk to someone soon and find out that your feelings are normal i wish you the best,Anxiety

for my whole life ive been very unconfident insecure and selfquestioning im super quiet because im scared of what people will think of me i avoid all social situations as it causes me great anxiety it is how both of my parents have always been and i feel like im doomed to that life also it makes it super hard for me at work as the other employees try to use me and walk all over me because im too nice it causes me depression and brings me down im in my early twenties and i really need to create a better life for myself ive been like this for so long so how do i change,one of the greatest ways that we can promote ourselves s by learning how to assert ourselves despite what most people think of when they hear the word assertive assertive communication is one of the best ways to manage interpersonal conflict as well as maintain personal boundaries once we become comfortable with acknowledging our boundaries there is usually a followup whereby we realize that we have the right to those boundaries in effect assertiveness communication becomes its own selfmotivating force in managing positive selfesteem you may want to invest in a workbook that can help you to develop these skills on your own or work directly with a therapist to develop them in a safe situation one of the workbooks that i have found to be very helpful is the assertiveness workbook how to express your ideas and stand up for yourself at work and in relationships by randy j paterson,Anxiety

i was raped a couple months ago since then along with other unfortunately events that have occurred i have been having trouble feeling emotions its almost as if im a sociopath lacking any feeling what can i do to change this,so believe it or not this is actually very common first off take a deep breath it does not mean that youre a sociopath all it means is that your brain has shifted into survival mode for a time and might need a little support to get back to normal our brain can play tricks on us after a trauma one thing that most people experience is the desire to push away or to avoid reminders of the trauma which include feelings of anxiety guilt anger fear and sometimes shame and if you think about it thats entirely understandable who would want to feel those yucky feelings or to be reminded of the trauma but here is the catch the more we try to push those unpleasant emotions away the more we are actually pushing away our ability to experience positive feelings emotions such as happiness excitement or closeness with loved ones become increasingly difficult to access most trauma survivors will experience this emotional blunting and is actually one of the things we look for when giving a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorderbut there is good news specialized trauma therapy using evidencebacked approaches can help us to experience the emotions were trying to push away in a safe environment its like our brain needs to fully digest what happened in order to return to emotional balance there are several approaches that can help you recover after a rape or other traumas these might include cognitive processing therapy prolonged exposure therapywritten exposure therapyeye movement desensitization reprocessingwhen youre considering looking for a therapist id strong encourage you to look for someone trained specifically in one of these approaches there are mountains of research studies showing that these therapies have the best success rate when recovering from things like rape a life threatening experience a natural disaster or other traumatic experiences breathe in breathe out you survived and life can get better trauma therapy is usually time limited 34 months and can help you take your life back you can do this,PTSD
i was raped a couple months ago since then along with other unfortunately events that have occurred i have been having trouble feeling emotions its almost as if im a sociopath lacking any feeling what can i do to change this,the fact that you are concerned shows that you absolutely have emotions about lacking emotions seems like you fear that you are becoming a sociopath and that alone shows you have emotionsit is incredibly normal to feel numb after a trauma like rape the emotional impact of rape can be beyond overwhelming which the brain responds to by basically suppressing those circuits from awareness it doesnt mean your emotions dont existyou brain is just trying to protect you from feeling them because our brains arent great at selectively burying emotions it tends to take them all at once so when new emotionally upsetting events happen the brain sees allowing any emotion through as a threat to the system so to speakspeaking to a counselor could help to process through how you are feeling about lacking emotion if you search in your area or online for a telehealth therapist chances are you will find a therapist that has a background in treating trauma that would suit your specific needs that may mean that they will recommend talking through your trauma which can seem like a very daunting task however the sooner you process through it the less it has the power to take over your lifeits actually really astonishing that you are reaching out for help and i so hope you are able to find what you need,PTSD
i was raped a couple months ago since then along with other unfortunately events that have occurred i have been having trouble feeling emotions its almost as if im a sociopath lacking any feeling what can i do to change this,i dont need to tell you that this is an incredible amount of serious stuff to happen in a short period when we go through a trauma it is natural for us to shut down as a way to protect ourselves a kind of freeze response think of a possum or a gazelle these animals go so far as to physically freeze in protection our emotions do the same thing sometimes we feel shut down and that can be strangea kind of disconnection this does not mean that you are sociopath or that your feelings will never come back the amazing thing though is that as time moves forward we naturally heal and emotions come back if you feel stuck seeking counseling is a way to help accelerate this healing and help you work through and begin healing wishing you the absolute best,PTSD
i was raped a couple months ago since then along with other unfortunately events that have occurred i have been having trouble feeling emotions its almost as if im a sociopath lacking any feeling what can i do to change this,im sorry to know this happened to you this is a normal response to traumatic events when we are pushed to the extreme and we are unable to escape we freeze which numbs us from pain but disconnects us from our bodies we oftentimes continue to feel that disconnection until we work through these traumas i would suggest working through your traumas with a therapist with methods like emdr somatic experiencing yoga therapy etc to get your emotions and fullness of life back,PTSD
i was raped a couple months ago since then along with other unfortunately events that have occurred i have been having trouble feeling emotions its almost as if im a sociopath lacking any feeling what can i do to change this,i am so sorry this has happened to you i hope you have some people you find emotionally supportive around you in terms of your question i understand what you are talking about sometimes when a person experiences a traumatic event an event called dissociation occurs dissociation is the brains way of temporary creating and increasing emotional distance between what is happening and what you are feeling and experiencing this is a kind of natural coping mechanism and it can occur just prior to during and after an event has occurred people describe the feeling as being numb or detached from others their surroundings and even from their own body all of these descriptions are accurate and they are your brains attempt to try and keep you safe from emotions that may otherwise overwhelm you this is good in the shortterm because you are not having to immediately face and cope with the immensely painful feelings associated with your trauma but it is also notsogood in that it also blocks your ability to feel positive and pleasurable emotions so while your brain is protecting you it is also preventing feelings you need now more than ever such as regaining a sense of safety soothing your hurts and feeling empowered for your survivalyou are not a sociopath so do not worry about that but i would strongly recommend that you consider seeing a therapist or other supportive mental health professional to help you work through what is happened there are ways for you to heal from your experience which will help you get back to a place where you can feel safe enough to feel again it might be an uncomfortable journey at times but you are already hurting and your life is being negatively impacted now good therapy sometimes is like pulling out a splinterit may hurt a bit to dig that sucker out but once its out your body can finally start to heal it might seem better and less painful to leave it alone and ignore avoid it but you risk infection by your inaction which will be 100 x worse than just digging it out best of luck to youlearn more about me and my practice at wwwemdrhealscom,PTSD

i was the one who ended it and im so glad i did it was the best decision i made in my life but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks it is creating a wall in my current relationship,ending an abusive relationship is often very difficult especially if you were very close initially without the presence of abuse if the abuse included verbal or psychological condemnation you will often have a negative selfimage that you may know is not true but often feels very true this negative selfimage and fear of being abused again can activate protections in you that were needed at the time you were abused but now create a wall in your current relationship the fact that you were able to end the relationship and know that you made the right decision is a great acknowledgement that you have solid internal resources to draw upon in healing from the abuse good for younightmares and flashbacks are a strong sign of memories including associated beliefs emotions and physical sensations that have remained unprocessed and therefore unhealed there are likely reminders called triggers of the past abuse that are being activated in your current relationship that are allowing these unhealed memories to come to the surface and affect both your sleep and your waking experiences this is certainly not something you are purposefully doing but is the result of what happened to you however you likely feel as if you are not in control the goal is protect your current relationship evaluate your selfimage for flaws in beliefs and feelings and begin working on healing your memories of abuse in many cases my use of emdr eye movement desensitization and reprocessing would be helpful in reducing the emotional strength of your abuse memories reduce or eliminate triggers bring healing and allow you to enjoy being in the present with your current relationship i would recommend discussing with your current partner your harmful past experiences your decision to pursue counseling and your strong desire to be healthy for your current relationship with a good support network in place healing is very possible,PTSD
i was the one who ended it and im so glad i did it was the best decision i made in my life but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks it is creating a wall in my current relationship,from what you describe about yourself i agree with you that ending your former relationship was a very wise decisionthe nightmares and flashbacks show that you were deeply affected emotionally and on the foundations of your basic naturethe way for these to stop is by the slow process of realizing how badly injured and frightened you were of your former partneronce youve stabilized yourself by accepting the tremendous harshness that was part of the former relationship then the nightmares and flashbacks will disappear gradually usually maybe all at oncethere is a possibility too that your former relationship connected with being emotionally ignored abandoned treated harshly during your time of growing up yearssince generally people choose partners who relate similarly to the ways in which they felt treated by parents it is possible that you had been badly treated while growing up and werent aware of this until going through this terrible relationshipcongratulations on ending your relationship,PTSD

i was the one who ended it and im so glad i did it was the best decision i made in my life but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks it is creating a wall in my current relationship,one thing you could try to do on your own is to focus on the partner who is in front of you now if you are able to connect with them via touch or focusing on their tone of voice that may help to center you tried to stay grounded andor mindful that is being aware of your position in the room your feet on the floor your hands in your lap or your hips in the chair being mindful of the environment you are currently for example noticing what is around you may be helpful try to use all your senses for example you could focus on hearing your husbands voice feeling his hand in yours being wrapped in your favorite blanket seeing a comforting photo using a comforting sense or candle or tasting an apple that reminds you of times when you have enjoyed yourself in the kitchenit also sounds like you are having a very specific reaction that could very well be related to trauma i would recommend that you talk with a local mental health professionalremember just because it was the best decision of your life that doesnt mean that what happened to you or in your presence automatically leaves you when you leave the relationship our brain is actually hardwired to remember things that have caused us pain or great emotional distress as a way of protecting us from them happening again this is a very natural response and the reactions you have as far as nightmares and flashbacks are the past coming forward and your brain trying to make sense of it all,PTSD
i was the one who ended it and im so glad i did it was the best decision i made in my life but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks it is creating a wall in my current relationship,emdr therapy has shown great results for work with ptsd symptoms which are similar to what you described if you are unable to find a local emdr specialist then i would suggest some meditation and journaling in addition to talk therapy to process your trauma your anxiety response centers int he brain are in hyper vigilance mode and retraining to turn down that response could be helpful for you,PTSD
i was the one who ended it and im so glad i did it was the best decision i made in my life but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks it is creating a wall in my current relationship,a lot of times when youre experiencing nightmares and flashbacks it can be a sign that you havent fully processed what happened our brains tend to replay scenes in our life that we wish had turned out differently or in an effort to desensitize us to it if you are comfortable with it you may want to consider sharing what youre experiencing with your current partner so that he is able to understand whats going on also you may want to consider what parts of your past relationship you blame yourself for this can be a difficult task to undertake on your own and the help of the therapist may be necessary to sort through the memories in a safe way typically however flashbacks and nightmares are a sign that the trauma of what you went through needs to be addressed its a great thing that you were able to have the courage to get out of that relationship and you should be proud of yourself for that you may want to begin therapy to address these traumatic memories and help you to sort through any conflicting emotions you have about it ie feeling like its your fault for not recognizing the abuse or getting out of the relationship sooner blaming yourself for being  the kind of person who gets into an abusive relationship  or believing that you somehow caused your ex to abuse you in some way these types of beliefs and feelings can prevent us from moving past traumatic experiences and a trained therapist can certainly help you sort through them,PTSD

my girlfriend was abused as a child now if i hug or touch her in any kind of way she says she feels as if she is being abused as a child what might be going on,sounds like she might be triggered and having a trauma response this is normal for folks whove experienced trauma the part of our brains that detects danger acts like a smoke alarm in our house its constantly scanning for threats and makes a bunch of noise if it detects one smoke alarms cant distinguish between smokey bacon cooking or an actual house fire  they just detect a threat and alert everyone of it our brain is similar her brain has probably learned that physical touch is dangerous for her so whatever response she has next is her brains way of trying to protect her particularly with sexual trauma this can be a really frustrating experience for romantic partners trying to connect physically or sexually,PTSD
my girlfriend was abused as a child now if i hug or touch her in any kind of way she says she feels as if she is being abused as a child what might be going on,thank you for your question i think its wonderful that you are approaching this with openness and curiosity the reaction you are describing is extremely common in survivors of abuse what you said is insightfulwhen you touch her she feels as if she is being abused as a child from your description i would agree that in those moments she is reexperiencing something that happened in the past as if it is happening right now reexperiencing or reliving traumatic experiences is a key symptom of ptsdif you are seeking to better understand what is going on for her i would highly recommend bessel van der kolks book the body keeps the score this book also discusses effective treatments for overcoming trauma best of luck to both of yousarah,PTSD
my boyfriend is seeking therapy he is in his s and has some childhood issues he has kids from his previous exwife and is unable to see them,probably the more important questions to answer concern how much confidence you have in you and your boyfriend becoming parents how you each feel about the influence of his being banned from seeing his current children and be clear about the circumstances that led up to the decision of him not being permitted to see his kidsdont allow some random professional to pronounce your boyfriend as cured a relatively qualified therapist would never make this callpsychological and emotional tensions emerge from our relationships within families you and your boyfriend are in a position to set a strong foundation for having children assuming each of you wants childrenchildhood issues your boyfriends anyones are more likely to go away when new patterns of interacting emergeif the two of you are engaged in setting a secure relationship as future parents the disappointments and hurt from the very early years will be replaced by better ways of interacting,PTSD

i have ptsd from childhood events and other traumas as an adult i have panic attacks nightmares anger and at times depression i feel like im always on the edge or just apathetic can i fix this by myself,when it comes to trauma especially in the event that it has caused you to develop ptsd there can be a lot of difficulty in attempting to resolve these issues on your own simply because of how strong your urge to avoid it whenever thoughts of the traumatic experience come up ptsd is best treated with the help of a mental health professional and if using the cognitive processing approach can be treated in as few as 17 weeks as for your other concerns many of these can be treated independently if you have the motivation to manage your way through panic attacks and depression specifically often respond well to selfhelp treatment manuals the centre for clinical interventions is a great online resource for workbooks to help you learn to manage the depression and panic attacks whether you decide to work through these concerns on your own or in professional therapy just know that your panic attacks must be managed prior to addressing your trauma hope this is helpful and if you have any other questions dont hesitate to ask,PTSD

i recently lost a friend to suicide im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it how can i handle this better,im so sorry to hear about your recent loss there is such a large feeling of uncertainty that befalls those of us left to sort through these emotions of such a loss and its never easy i think its important to remember that there is no right or wrong way to deal with loss and the best way for you may not be the best way for someone else the fact that you are aware that you are smoking more marijuana and drinking more and the fact that you can recognize that these may not be the best coping techniques is a very good step towards giving yourself some better support at this time marijuana and drinking are type of coping techniques that can numb us to our emotions but they do not really help us to work through those emotions when it comes to grief often one of the most helpful ways to move through the phases of grief is to use your social supports talk to your friends and family see your mutual friends and commiserate with each other on the loss and the uncertainty the more we talk about our feelings the more we are okay with them being ours the more we express our loss the better we become at accepting such a loss in talking with your supports you may also decide ways in which you may want to remember your friend ways you can do so on a personal level writing a poem planting a tree etc or ways you as a group can remember and memorialize them a special day where you get together to share your memories starting a charity etc we never truly get over our losses but we can learnt o accept the losses and what it means to us nowbut that also takes time,PTSD
i recently lost a friend to suicide im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it how can i handle this better,suicide is not a natural way to pass from this earth so many times it can be extremely tough to deal with because of the unnaturalness of the event we may find ourselves feeling guilty that we did not see it or that we couldve have done more or something to stop it but often the fish in the fishbowl cannot see that which is closest to him you are currently trying to numb your feelings those feelings as nasty as they are are meant to be felt those feelings help us to process the event and also help us to pass through the situation your friend has a legacy remember it and honor that legacy everyday in some small or even grand way perhaps committing or volunteering your time to help others in honor of your friendhope this helps c,PTSD
i recently lost a friend to suicide im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it how can i handle this better,first of all i am very sorry for your loss and i can understand the urge to drink and smoke to try and cope as im sure you understand alcohol and marijuana may take the edge off of the pain in the short run but in the long run they may prevent you from being able to work through the thoughts and feelings that you have about the loss of your friend grieving is a process that is unique to each individual and each relationship that may involve difficult confusing and even contradictory seeming thoughts and feelings and a competent therapist can help you work through this process it also may be useful for you to add other ways of coping such as taking care of yourself through exercise doing healthy activities that you love and spending time with people that you love self care is often most difficult when we need it the most thank you for reaching out,PTSD
i recently lost a friend to suicide im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it how can i handle this better,let me begin by offering my condolences for your loss i can understand how difficult this time maybe for you especially if you have several unanswered the questions due to the circumstances surrounding the death of your friend its during this time that you may experience the various stages of grief this includes denial anger bargaining depression and finally acceptance in the bereavement process there is so specific time frame or lengths of time for someone to work through each step its imperative to note that one may express each stage with different levels of intensity also the five stages do not necessarily occur in any specific order we often move between stages before achieving a more peaceful acceptance of death just note that everyone greives differently some internalize their feelings and emotions others express it externally while other avoid it all togethercoping with loss is ultimately a deeply personal and singular experience sometimes we feel that no one understands what we are feeling or going through much less comprehend our emotional state of mind  whats important is that you allow others to comfort you through the various stages my recommendation is to allow yourself to go through the emotions and feel the grief avoiding or resisting may only delay the healing process reaching the acceptance stage of mourning is a gift not not everyone is awarded but seeking the help of a grief counselor may assist in deciphering your emotions and set you on a more positive path to achieve closer,PTSD
i recently lost a friend to suicide im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it how can i handle this better,suicide is a very traumatic loss and affects survivors significantly everyone deals with their grief in different ways one way i recommend to deal with the loss of a loved one is to write letters to them some people like to keep the letters in a jar maybe fill the jar with sand so the letters are buried i recommend writing the letters as often as you need to you will notice over time the need to write the letters will decrease and the intense feelings of loss will decrease i also recommend finding a survivors support group in your area you can find more information on wwwafsporg,PTSD
i recently lost a friend to suicide im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it how can i handle this better,i urge you to seek some therapeutic help for this and also to connect with others who knew your friend because theyre likely feeling the same way suicide is difficult to understand and those left behind have many mixed emotions that make their grief complicated and anguished your friend either had an impulse that no one could stop or they made a big decision that impacted everyone around them there are other things you can do to cope with this and it has to do with accepting your powerlessness to stop it not blaming yourself forgiving your friend and finding meaning in their life and yours you wont find that meaning in a bottle or a joint i hope you reach out soon,PTSD
i recently lost a friend to suicide im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it how can i handle this better,first i am so sorry for your loss most people go through the grieving process i would get a better understanding of what that process is everyone has their own way of handling loss you are taking the first step in realizing that you are having a difficult time coping with it i would reach out to a therapist that has experience treatment patients with loss i would also recognize that drinking and smoking are both substances that will not make depression or depressive thoughts any better,PTSD
i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems,you are right on to recognize that the effects of trauma can be cumulative it is very possible that a car accident could lead to an increase in ptsd symptoms that were related to other traumatic experiencesif you have been deployed to a combat area you are most likely eligible for free counseling services through the va vet centers the vet center clinicians typically have a lot of experience working with military trauma heres a link to a directory of vet centershttpwwwvagovdirectoryguidevetcenteraspyour service and sacrifice is greatly appreciated,PTSD
i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems,the short answer is yes with a maybe tagged on the end let me explain first off thank you for serving our country the vast majority of the population will never understand the sorts of experiences that military members have encountered and we know that veterans suffer from ptsd at higher percentages than civilians we also know that motor vehicle accidents are the most common cause of ptsd my friend youve been struggling it seems so it can be helpful to think of ptsd symptoms like a wave or a series of waves sometimes the waves are larger and last for longer and sometimes theyre easier to manage one of the most common ways for ptsd waves to be more challenging is due to something we call avoidance we avoid both internal things thinking about the trauma avoiding unpleasant emotions etc but also external reminders perhaps driving in a car being in crowds being around loud noises people standing behind you etc and the more we push that stuff away the longer those waves stick around therefore trauma therapy usually involves confronting that avoidance in safe and protected ways to try to reteach your brain that even through something might feel upsetting it doesnt mean that youre actually in danger let me give you an example lets say you avoid being in a crowd your ptsd wants to convince you that all crowds are dangerous and between you and me we both know that there are some crowds that are absolutely dangerous if youre in a biker bar where people are smoking meth and throwing knives at dartboardsthats probably a pretty dangerous place to be but maybe you dont hang out in biker bars maybe youre just trying to pick up your milk and eggs at the grocery store when your crowdavoidance kicks in well those two environments are very different could something dangerous happen in the grocery store yes is it likely that youre in danger probably not and so if youve worked through the ptsd from the military but then go through a car accident it might be that some of those old avoidant patterns are popping back up the good news however is that there are several different options through the va vet center or private counseling that can help look for whats called an evidencebased approach these are things like cognitive processing therapy prolonged exposure therapy written exposure therapy or eye movement desensitization reprocessing your counselor can help you decide which might be the best approach for you ptsd is very treatable you dont have to suffer reach out to a qualified therapist,PTSD
i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems,it depends on what you mean by problems however a therapist who specializes in ptsd i can say it wouldnt be uncommon to see an increase in ptsd symptoms or severity after something like a car accident it is just adding trauma onto trauma sort of like kicking you when you are down your body may not have the same resources to handle the car accident as it did at other times in your life hopefully that makes sense,PTSD
i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems,a car accident can be scary and possibly trigger your symptoms of ptsd it is good that you recognize the possibility of this occurringnot everyone who experiences a car accident develops ptsd the chances are definitely increased due to your prior diagnosis during military servicesome of the things to be mindful of for yourself include1 feelings of anxiety and increased heart rate when youre faced with reminders of the event2 feeling a little more on edge when youre driving3being more watchful youre more likely to scan your environment for potential sources of threats4 avoidance because of the anxiety that often follows an accident its natural that you may want to avoid some situations or experience hesitation at timesif you experience any of these symptoms or feel other symptoms of ptsd it would be advisable to seek help possibly through your local va medical clinic or a private practitioner there are certain modalities such as emdr that can help with your symptoms,PTSD
i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems,there are many types of traumas and they certainly can compound on one another as you experience them without treating the traumas or incidents where you felt there was a significant risk to your safety or that of others there can be a cumulative effect what we have learned in the mental health field from studying traumas is that the body as a whole responds to these stressors in order to keep you safe during the events if the body does not realize that it no longer needs to respond in this way because the event is now over and then receives a trigger from a new event it makes sense that the new event could cause additional issues both of these events can be addressed with the help of a counselor there are many counselors that specialize in trauma inside and outside of the va so shop around if you are able and find someone that you connect with,PTSD
i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems,a car accident can be a traumatic event especially if it was serious you could have feared for your life felt everythingvwas out of control and had normal reactions to an abnormal situation afterwards this may or may not be related to the traumas that you experienced in the military if it is then it is possible that you will see a direct effect in triggering off ptsd symptoms even if it didnt it is possible that the complexity of the two situations will interact inside you to be a combined response having already been diagnosed with ptsd this might be a good time to reconnect with the help system you had around military experiences and explore it a little bit about the new experience the right exploration does not have to make things worse and can be a good source of prevention,PTSD
i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems,post traumatic stress disorder can occur after any traumatic event where a real and present threat of harm or loss of life to yourself or others is present yes a car accident could increase ptsd symptoms such as hypervigilance anxiety nightmares replaying the event etc depending on the severity of the accident new triggers might exist this is not to say that you cannot recover are you currently experiencing additional trauma symptoms,PTSD
my mother has quite severe undiagnosed ocd diagnosed posttraumatic stress disorder and maybe other mental health issues she is weeks away from moving in with me my husband and our three children i love my mother but once she gets within her own area she begins to tape all cracks and crevasses she cannot tolerate any smells,one way to handle the situation is to develop willingness to tolerate her unusual habits would you be willing to talk with your kids that grandma is sensitive to smells and her way to address this is to tape up cracks and crevassesas long as her behavior isnt aggressive harmful to anyone unethical or immoral and youd like her to live with you then someone both sides need to be happy with the living conditionalso if you havent already done so negotiate with your mom that the common family areas are off limits to taping the the cracks as part of adjusting to living with your family it is reasonable to expect she respect common areas and to limit her taping habit to her private sections within the houseapproach the matter fairly and with the expectation to satisfy all the people who are affected,PTSD
i have family issues and my dad was both violent and a cheater,sorry that your growing up years in the family were so unsafe and painfuleveryone has family legacy patterns of behavior and ways of handling emotions handed down to them simply by livingall of what any child observes and how they are treated within their family context creates their foundational expectations of othersthe best way of releasing yourself form hurtful interaction patterns is by being aware of your own feelings and intuition within close relationshipsif you have a similar sense of hurt or that something is wrong yet in a familiar way then most likely you are in a relational pattern similar to the negative ones in your family of originthis realization moment is your chance to more deeply see your own original trauma and try different ways of responding to these similar key situationsthis type of work takes a lot of repeated effort because trauma is deep and childhood trauma is attached to loving ones parentsexpect slow progress and expect more than a few tearsif it feels overwhelming then a therapist for guidance and support would be very beneficial to the work youd be doing within yourselfsending lots of good luck,PTSD
i have family issues and my dad was both violent and a cheater,hi new york theres no way to keep your past from affecting your present and future because its a huge part of who we are the good news is though that the effect doesnt have to be negative im met many people who have horrific pasts and it helps them know confidently every day what kind of person they want to be and what kind of world they want to live in and it helps them make really great decisions you can accept your past integrate your traumas and move forward in a very different way if you see negative ways in which your past affects you and this is also common you are wise to seek professional help without knowing more its impossible to give you a lot of direction here basically our past creates emotional bruises that are touch on and triggered by present situations but our reactions are often about more than just the present moment i think you know thati wish you the best as you sort it out,PTSD
i have family issues and my dad was both violent and a cheater,i can imagine how incredibly difficult this must be for you having past traumatic experiences creap up on you without warning can be very scary and stressful you may be suffering from symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder getting evaluated by a professional would be a good step to take next by seeking treatment and having a therapist who you trust and can connect with you will gain the ability to think about your experiences without it significantly interfering with your daily functioning a therapist can also help you to develop new coping stragies to be used during recall of these experiences and help you to adopt healthy thought patterns i would also recommend that you seek support from loved ones sometimes just talking about your experiences and associated feelings will alleviate some of the emotional troubles you are suffering from lastly you may find meditation or mindfulness work to be of great benefit having the ability to live in the present moment should reduce the effects of your traumatic experiences interfering with recalling your past or looking forward to your future i wish you all the best,PTSD
i have family issues and my dad was both violent and a cheater,in general our past is always somewhat alive and does inform our present experiences all past experiences both positive and negative are what have brought you where you are today physically and emotionally that being said your fathers behavior does not have to define you or your future you have power over your life and your future by learning more about yourself you can learn to incorporate your past into your present life without being defined by past traumas the best way to grow and learn how to do this is to talk with someone about your experiences by talking about your past and present struggles with a trusted confidante or helping professional you will hopefully learn how to be at peace with your past,PTSD

im fine when we start becoming intimate but out of nowhere i will get a flashback of what happened to me in the past i start hysterically crying and freaking out when my boyfriend obviously has done nothing to hurt me,sexual intimacy can be very triggering for survivors even when it is both wanted and consensual you may want to consider seeing a therapist who specializes in trauma to work through the abuse if you have not already done so often times triggers still hold such a powerful effect when the emotions related to the abuse have not been fully processed in the meantime you may want to consider coming up with a safe word to let your partner know that you are being triggered or to communicate your physical boundaries to him often times the experience of communicating your physical boundaries to your partner having those boundaries respected and validated and having a partner who is understanding and willing to engage in intimacy in such a way that does not violate your physical boundaries can reinforce a sense of safety with him,PTSD

an organization admitted to implanting thoughts in my head with technologies the study was to implant a fantasy other people are having but to me its a nightmare i lost my kids my job and all that i was an unwilling participant i no longer trust a therapist im too afraid to go under hypnosis or anything,given your experience of being imposed upon against your will and all the personal and professional loss that has come since your fear of what will happen if you undergo treatment and trust a therapist is understandable there is no technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away or be reversed however there are things that you can do which may help you to change your relationship to the thoughts and to the distress that they cause i understand that working with a therapist sounds risky given your experiences and at the same time a good therapist may be a beneficial resource in helping you deal with the intrusive thoughts cope with and alleviate the stress that they create and perhaps even lead to the alleviation of the thoughts themselves a therapist may also be able to help you discover strategies to work towards any goals you have around reconnecting with your children and working again if therapy feels too unsafe at the moment i would recommend looking into workbooks on how to deal with intrusive thoughts and coping with stress some popular approaches that you may want to look into are mindfulness techniques acceptance and commitment therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy you may even be able to find some of these resources at a library if affordability is an obstacle,PTSD
i did some horrible sexual things as a kid and i regret everything can someone help me cope with myself can someone help me remember my past,im very sorry to hear this hypnosis can be a valuable tool that a trained therapist can use to bring back suppressed memories however keep in mind that hypnosis doesnt work for everyone i think regardless speaking with a therapist about your sexual issues would be beneficial it seems like you have experienced some painful experiences in the past and may need help dealing with them in order to move forward in addition if past memories do resurface a trained therapist will be able to help you cope with them as they arise i wish you the best of luck and i hope you receive the treatment that you deserve,PTSD

last year i just always felt hopeless i dont have a great relationship with my sister i lost my mother recently and that really added to my sadness my sister always brings up how i was never close to my mother,i am so sorry about your loss losing someone you love is always difficult however losing a mother is a significant loss in a daughters life what makes this loss complicated is that it appears you have also had a loss in your relationship with your sister it is difficult to know what happened with your sister with the limited information you have provided but what i suspect is that there are some unresolved issues between the two of you and that she may be projecting her pain on to you it is important to remember that your sister is also grieving the loss of your mother and may not be dealing with it in a very healthy way by her bringing up your relationship with your mother and suggesting that you were never close to her is her opinion only you can define and determine what your relationship was like with your mother if there is truth to this then it may be something you may need to talk about with a counselor there could be an added layer of ambiguous loss in that you are not only grieving her physical absence but could be grieving the loss of a relationship you wish you could have had with her and the realization that you never will you and your sister are both in the heart of the grieving cycle when two people are grieving the same loss at the same time it is difficult to provide support to each other because of their own struggle even if they both were on good terms with each other depression is part of the cycle of grief it is absolutely normal to feel sad as well as experiencing other depressive symptoms ie feelings of isolation lack of motivation low energy sleep or appetite changes etc anger is another phase of the grief cycle your sister may be stuck in the anger phase not wanting to connect with her own feelings of sadness so this may be why she is being hurtful towards you in projecting her anger onto you in order to avoid the vulnerability of experiencing her own grieffinally it appears that your depression proceeded the loss of your mother and is making your experience with grief more complicated were you officially diagnosed and treated for depression prior to your loss depression in grief is different than a depressive mood disorder depression can be situational ie triggered by an event or related to genetics undiagnosed health issues stress trauma or other potential risk factors if you have a family history of depression you are more susceptible to have depression it would be wise for you to discuss this with a mental health provider and if necessary get treatment through counseling and medical interventions,Stress

my wife is trying to leave she agreed to come back and give me a little time even said she hopes i can do it we buried our first born in jan  years ago she never got past it so every year around this time she gets emotional and says she doesnt think she loves me but then we go back to normal this time another guy came in and showed her attention ill forgive the cheating if shell come home,im sorry that you lost your first born child death of a child always leaves a permanent reminder to the parents of a very painful time in their livesthe good news is your awareness that you and your wife are not connected in a satisfying waythere are many possible areas to examine in your relationship as partners and as parentsif what you write here are your observations and theories about your wifes outlook and conclusions then the first step is to directly have conversations together on the topics you write herewhat needs clarifying is what her reasons are for wanting to leave the marriageoften a crisis such as a childs death motivates someone to look deeply into other intimate relationships keep in mind that looking deeply doesnt necessarily mean leaving the marriagealso be aware of your own frustrations and marital discontent be ready to talk about your feelings and uncertaintiesthere is no such thing as one happy partner in a marriage and one unhappy partner each person is part of a system and can only be as satisfied as their partnerthe conversations that open relationship hurts and disappointments hold a lot of emotion they are difficult to keep on trackbest recommendation is to find a couples therapist who will be neutral to each of you as individuals and help both of you examine the true health of the relationship,Stress

what can i do to stop grieving my mothers death when i am awake i just cry every day i dont have anyone to talk to i need help i am still cry over her will i ever stop crying its been  years,i am sorry that you lost your mother that is a really hard thing for someone to go throughthere is really no set time for grief to be over but i agree that if it has been three years and you are still crying every day then this is past the time for normal grief i do not know how old you are and if you are in school or have a job but i would imagine that if by now you literally were doing nothing but crying every day all day someone would have noticed and would have gotten you some help for one thing bills have to be paidthere are typically five stages of grief and they can come in any order you can go back to another stage that you previously experienced denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance are the stages at first people are usually in denial over the fact that they lose someone or are losing someone this may mean that you deny they are ill or deny that they have actually diedthen comes bargaining in which you may beg god that if you can only have this person back then you will do whatever depression is when the reality has settled in and when we cry and really feel the loss it sounds like you are stuck in this phasefinally acceptance is when we accept that it has happened and we pick up the pieces of our life and move onwhen we lose someone we never forget them we may always have certain days that are tough such as holidays or any special remembrance of your loved one but we do get to the place where we accept that death is part of life and that it is inevitable and that life goes ona therapist can help you explore the reasons for your extended grief and can help you with coping skills to better deal with it one suggestion i have is not to try to run from the sad feelings dont try to not feel them embrace the feelings let the feelings wash over you and accept them trying not to feel something is not going to help sadness is a part of life and needs to be felt just like happiness does unpleasant feelings are not to be avoidedi am sincerely sorry that you lost your mother and that you have had such a hard time of it for three years now you deserve to be happy and to live a full life i am sure your mother would not want you being sad for so long i wish you all the best as you continue to try to heal from this loss and deal with your grief,Stress

im planning to have baby so i have to quit smoking but its hard sometimes its not a physical need its mental i cannot help myself from thinking about smoking what can i do to get rid of this addiction,hi good for you in planning ahead to do whats healthiest for your baby and yourself thats a great first step its also good that you are able to identify that its not always a physical need thats driving the addictionfor the next steps i would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur the psychological or mental cravings are usually based out of habit such as having a cigarette after a meal and if youre consciously trying to quit youll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel etc etc well if im on a diet and i continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer eventually ill give in and eat ityoure going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette thats normal and for the most part out of your control but you choose whether or not to continue thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought thats what you would have to work on changing when you have that initial thought acknowledge it ok i kind of want a cigarette now but then change the thoughts that typically follow distract yourself think about something else do something else whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigaretteive suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what theyre going to do when the time comes write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it eventually it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have itbest of luck and you have a really great motivator to quit  your baby,Addiction

im planning to have baby so i have to quit smoking but its hard sometimes its not a physical need its mental i cannot help myself from thinking about smoking what can i do to get rid of this addiction,its very admirable that you are trying to stop smoking for the sake of your health and your childs health the mental aspect of quitting a drug can and usually is the hardest part first it can be helpful to change the focus of your thinking so you are focusing on the healthy behaviors you will startimprove rather than only focusing on the behavior that you are trying to stop the reason for this is that our brains hear the main topic of our thoughts that is when you tell yourself quit smoking quit smoking quit smoking your brain hears smoking smoking smoking so we need to put together a selfcare plan that addresses your thinking emotions and behaviors nutrition physical activity and other stress reducing activities the idea is to have an effective plan in place to both prevent yourself from feeling intense stress which increases cravings and to have a wellplaced plan for when the intense cravings inevitably present themselves and lastly and possibly the most important you have to believe you deserve to be the healthiest version of yourself think about the times when you are most vulnerable to smoke stressful situations after meals when drinking social situations etc the use of affirmations is also an important resource as what we say to ourselves effects our mood repeatedly telling yourself i am healthy i am getting healthier my lungs are becoming clear and healthy or other affirmations like this even if you dont believe them at first continue saying them this step is important to improve cognitive flexibility which trains your brain to be open to change think about activities that you like to do or that you would like to try and replace smoking with those activities any activity that can make you laugh time with friends watching comedies etc will evoke a calming response because when we feel happy we typically dont feel stressed out simultaneously,Addiction

my friend is abusing her prescription medicine even though she told me she didnt have any more pills i found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications,your friend needs to admit they have a problem if not no matter how many pills you take they will find a way to get more it is also a federal offense to take someone elses medication so if you did take it she could have you arrested in other instances it can be more dangerous to take medication away than slowly tapering off of them like anything we put into our system our tolerance builds up and can effect us in different ways i would listen to her and discuss why she feels that she needs to be on the medications rather than playing bad cop in this situation encourage her to get help and let her know you re there for her,Addiction

i have bipolar ii disorder im addicted to alcohol and weed and im hopeless i keep drinking even though its harming myself and others,anyone who wants to change their life path eventually will be successful in this how to stop abusing alcohol involves a few steps most of them time consuming with slow progress and very often with tremendous emotional painthe basic path is to figure out what motivates you to drink too much and be addicted to weed almost always addictions are rooted in the person having suffered feeling deeply ignored humiliated shamed invisible nothing very pleasant since a very young age usually starting around 18 monthsmost often addicts are sensitive people who have been emotionally overburdened by the grownups in their familywith no outlet for emotional expression or nurturing the frustration goes inward until the emotional pain feels very big and without an outletso people mask and numb by substances whether this is food chocolate work alcohol weedtherapy that is humanistic based is a better fit than one which is drug oriented and diagnosis orientedif youd like getting serious about knowing who you are including any unfair treatment of you during your growing up years you can do thisonce you have a stronger selfrespect and awareness you would naturally avoid substances because they harm people harming oneself is the opposite of selfrespectalso about your diagnosis it may not be true at all the us healthcare system loves selling drugs to people and clinicians in agencies and clinics are encouraged to find something wrong with people in order to find a new customer who will take drugssee if you can find a therapist who is independent minded and therefore free to interact therapeutically with you as a human being not as a potential customer if they are able to label you as having something wrongthis simply continues the long line of being shamed by others that created the addiction problem in the first placegood luck,Addiction

i have bipolar ii disorder im addicted to alcohol and weed and im hopeless i keep drinking even though its harming myself and others,the first step to change is to admit that you have a problem that is in need of change frequently our problems keep us in denial although feeling hopeless is an uncomfortable feeling it suggests to me that you know that you can not do this alone the best course of treatment for you is to treat all of these problems together alcohol detox can be very dangerous so it is important that you do this under the supervision of a medical provider preferably someone who specializes in addiction know also that although marijuana may not appear to be as big as a problem as alcohol is it will cause you to have an increase in alcohol cravings so complete abstinence from drugs and alcohol is needed i really recommend an inpatient stay for at least 30 days for anyone who is dealing with addiction whether combined with mental health issues or not if this is not a possibility then the next best thing would be an intensive outpatient program that treats both addiction and mental health issues know that there is hope for what you are experiencing you can get control over these issues the next step is finding the team andor facility that is going to help you do it,Addiction

i have a problem with binge eating especially during times of stress i binge eat and feel so overwhelmed with shame and disappointment that i end up going to the gym and trying to exercise the calories off i am in my late s and i have been dealing with this since i was a teenager are there any coping mechanisms i can use to break this cycle,hellothis question describes a very typical setup of what is called the binge repent repeat cycle this means that typically after you binge you experience emotions as you described shame and disappointment and then because of these emotions you repent ie vow to never binge again promise to do better go to the gym etc and then ultimately end up bingeing again there are many coping mechanisms for binge eating and one of the best is actually attempting to normalize eating meaning you need to attempt to eat normally eating appropriately portioned meals 3 times a day with snacks in between if you binge then it may be helpful to remind yourself that when you attempt to compensate for your bingeing behaviors and you end up feeling restricted from over exercising or undereating then this actually leads to a binge again thus reverting you back to the cycle if you binge it will be helpful to try and get back on a normal schedule of eating instead of trying to compensate for the binge although it may feel counterproductive getting back on a normal eating schedule will prevent you from entering into the restrictive cycle it can also be helpful to remind yourself that the binge has already occurred it is in the past and the goal is to move forward without focusing on the past focus on what you can do differently next time what emotions or situations led up to the binge what can you to do prevent or change the circumstances that led to the binge or the way that you handled the situation lastly if youre struggling with normalizing eating it can be helpful to work with a professional that can provide counseling and coaching to help you learn how to eating normally mindfully and without feeling the guilt and other harmful emotions sometimes associated with disordered eating i would be more than happy to assist you if you ever have any questions or want to reach out to somebody you can contact me via my website httpwwwmaddenwellnesskycom,Addiction

i have no self control over food most people stop when theyve had enough but i keep eating for the pleasure of it especially with sweets im never done eating dessert,hello im so glad you decided to write in today this is such a great question and im sure many others will relate to exactly what youre describing there are a few different ways we can look at in understanding your concern first i think its important to understand food is just food food is meant to nourish our bodies provide us with energy and yes sometimes reserved for special occasions and celebrations but in many cultures we place a lot of emphasis on food we have food at every gathering and every celebration whats more people have come to almost expect food to be present at any and every gettogether and if its not well then forget about it i see this time and time again with my clients donuts appear in the office and its almost like donuts have never been there before must eat one or two however we need to remind ourselves that this occurrence or similar ones will not be the last time we can enjoy this particular food it is likely the office donuts have happened before and they will be there again on another day during these moments i like to have my clients employ a stopandthink method stopandthink about your goals before you eat is this donut getting you where you want to be also i have my clients ask themselves how special is this donut if the donut really is a special donut from the best bakery in town and youve never been there before then now might be a time to have the donut but if not it would be wise to pass and wait until that special donut another aspect we need to remember about food is to think about what were getting from overindulging or overeating are you trying to drown out other emotions are you trying to feel better and the food gives you that feeling for a brief moment what else is going on this can be determined by utilizing what we describe as a thought record a thought record involves tracking and identifying thoughts and feelings associated with food triggers by targeting the emotions we can then determine where theyre coming from as well as how to decipher them a therapist can also help you with understanding your emotions related to food and will be helpful in assisting you with the thought recordthe most important thing to remember is that food addiction can be a real problem for a lot of people if food is taking over your life and you are preoccupied and overwhelmed with knowing where to start please seek out help binge eating is the most common eating disorder and impacts the lives of thousands there are lots of free resources and information on my website at wwwmaddenwellnesskycom in addition i offer individual coaching and counseling through my website and i would love to help amber,Addiction
i have no self control over food most people stop when theyve had enough but i keep eating for the pleasure of it especially with sweets im never done eating dessert,i would recommend removing yourself from the environment you are in after you have finished eating a simple walk around the block calling up a friend and going to visit or even going to another room in the house can help if you find that you truly have no self control over food i recommend attending overeaters anonymous a 12 step group for those with compulsive issues related to food i hope this helps,Addiction
my father is an alcoholic and i see tendencies of that in myself i am recently married and i feel it affecting our relationship im not sure why i do it but i want to stop how can i find the willpower,congratulations on taking the first step on the road towards recovery by acknowledging the problem and asking for help the american society of addiction medicine defines addiction as a treatable chronic medical disease involving complex interactions among brain circuits genetics the environment and an individuals life experiences people with addiction use substances or engage in behaviors that become compulsive and often continue despite harmful consequences notice that nothing in the definition speaks about willpower or motivation thats because addiction is a disease  just like diabetes or high blood pressure imagine i gave a huge piece of chocolate cake to a diabetic after he eats the cake i say to him use your willpower to lower your glucose to 100 do you think he would be successful all addictions are behaviors behavior can be understood in terms of function and reinforcement all behavior is either an attempt to get something or an attempt to get away from something if you apply this logic to addictive behaviors the use of moodaltering substances is an attempt to create a particular feeling or emotion or an attempt to numb one when a behavior is reinforced we are more likely to engage in the same behavior again in the future lets assume that im feeling very anxious i drink some alcohol and notice that my anxiety decreases my brain takes note of this and the next time im feeling anxious i am more likely to reach for a bottle now imagine this happening hundreds if not thousands of times addiction recovery is about identifying and treating the underlying reasons for the use a qualified addiction therapist will assist you in developing a relapse prevention plan that addresses these underlying issues and helps you to identify triggers for your use additionally you will learn how to avoid triggers and gain healthy coping skills to use instead of relying on alcohol i wish you the best of luck in your endeavors recovery can be difficult and requires a willingness to change just about everything in your life but the rewards are tremendous,Addiction
this is my recovery and i dont feel that it is okay for them to ask this they told me it is policy due to the fact that i may run into a peer there i am a peer counselor in the small community that i grew up in i am in recovery myself i was asked to come work for this organization after i was two years sober i was in treatment in this organization i work with mental health peers and run life skill groups i dont work with substance peers,you definitely want to make sure not to inadvertently create an inappropriate dual relationship with a client in fact it is not uncommon for state regulatory boards to determine that a clinician and client being in the same 12 step group is professional misconduct you might want to consider attending a 12 step meeting that is located in a different community than the one you work in another option would be to look for oneonone or small group recovery support,Addiction

this is my recovery and i dont feel that it is okay for them to ask this they told me it is policy due to the fact that i may run into a peer there i am a peer counselor in the small community that i grew up in i am in recovery myself i was asked to come work for this organization after i was two years sober i was in treatment in this organization i work with mental health peers and run life skill groups i dont work with substance peers,i worked for an organization that had a similar policy although im not aware of it ever being enforced most of the employees were in recovery and active in 12step programs it has always been my personal practice that if i am present at a meeting and encounter a current client i will leave no questions asked if i encounter a former client i may decide to stay depending on how involved i was in the treatment of that client but i will not share during the meeting to avoid any inappropriate selfdisclosure i live in a relatively large city with a lot of groups so its possible to find meetings where i dont run into clients this can be much more challenging in a smaller city i understand that you dont work directly with peers in substance abuse treatment but we know that many of our clients with chronic mental illness also have chemical dependency issues therefore it is possible that you might encounter them at 12step meetings perhaps you could try online meetings or consider driving to an adjacent city or town to attend meetings,Addiction

for some reason i look at my phone and in no time five hours has passed during those five hours im playing games and trying to find out how to make my phone fun to use so i dont feel like i wasted my time trying to improve my phones performance in my life,start by spending small amounts of time with your own thoughts and feelingsalways being focused on what a phone offers keeps people at a distance from knowing themselvesas long as you make time to spend in an activity which is not interactive the way a phone is and instead depends only upon your actions you will be investing time and energy into your own lifewhether by consciously considering your own interests or doing housecleaning or chores by devoting yourself to areas which you decide to be involved in you will increase your knowledge of your own intereststhen to not be so involved with your phone will be natural and easy,Addiction
i have a relative who is in his twenties he was in a drug rehabilitation program and got kicked out for using drugs again no one informed family that he was using drugs again he subsequently overdosed and was found dead is their accountability of counselors therapists or the halfway house for not reporting that he had relapsed is there a legal case for failing to report,im so sorry to hear of your loss this sounds like a really difficult situation for the whole family since the answer to this question will depend a lot on the applicable state laws i would suggest talking with a local attorney that being said i see two competing issues here on the one side is the duty of confidentiality the counselors owed to your relative on the other side is the duty the counselors had to act reasonably to protect your relative from harm generally there is not a requiremt for substance abuse treatment centers to notify family members if an adult client relapsesa local attorney will be able to provide more specific guidance on the legal obligtions and liabilities in this situation,Addiction
